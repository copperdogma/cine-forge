INT. COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO

A cramped studio hums with old gear. Rain taps the skylight in steady rhythm.
ARIA threads a tape reel while NOAH checks a cracked mixer. JUNE balances two mugs of tea on a stack of scripts.

JUNE
If this works, half the valley hears us.

NOAH
(trying to sound calm)
If this works, we hear them too.

ARIA
Then we stop talking and start listening.

The ON AIR light flickers once, then goes dark.

CUT TO:

EXT. HILLTOP WATER TOWER - NIGHT

Wind lashes prayer flags tied to the guardrail. ARIA and NOAH climb a rusted service ladder with a portable antenna.
Far below, town lights blink in uneven clusters.

NOAH
I still vote for warm studios and bad coffee.

ARIA
We lost warm. Keep the coffee dream alive.

A burst of static jumps from the handheld receiver. They freeze.

NOAH
Did you hear that?

ARIA
Only enough to hope.

They lock the antenna in place and point it toward the dark ridge line.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT

Fluorescent lights buzz. KELL tapes handwritten evacuation arrows to the wall.
JUNE hurries past with batteries and tangled cables. A PARAMEDIC kneels beside an elderly neighbor, checking her pulse.

KELL
Generator room flooded. We can run one board, maybe two.

JUNE
One board is enough.

KELL
For news, maybe. For miracles?

JUNE
(half-smiling)
We schedule those after midnight.

She shoulders open the control-room door.

INT. COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

Monitors glow back to life one by one. The mood is briefly playful as everyone cheers too loudly.

NOAH (V.O.)
Tower looks stable. Feed us a carrier tone.

ARIA adjusts the gain. JUNE taps the mic.

JUNE
Good evening, Red Creek. If you're out there, key once and wait.

Silence.

Then three tiny chirps answer in sequence.

The room stills. The cheer dies. Nobody jokes now.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - PRE-DAWN

Rain has thinned to mist. A dozen neighbors gather under tarps, listening to a battery radio on a folding table.
Children pass blankets. Someone starts a kettle on a camp stove.

KELL
You hear that? They're naming road closures by mile marker.

ELDER WOMAN
My sister's on mile fourteen.

JUNE
We're recording every call sign. We'll relay until sunup.

A second receiver crackles. This signal is weaker, but clear enough.

UNKNOWN VOICE (RADIO)
Red Creek station, this is north shelter. We copy your broadcast.

A ripple of relief runs through the square.

CUT TO:

INT. COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - MORNING

Wet coats hang from every chair. The storm has passed, leaving pale light on the consoles.
ARIA marks a map with circles and arrows while NOAH logs frequencies.
JUNE pins a new sign above the door: OPEN FREQUENCY.

NOAH
We were supposed to be a music station.

ARIA
We still are.

JUNE hits PLAY on a cassette deck. A bright brass riff fills the room.

JUNE
Announcements on the hour. Songs in between.

KELL enters, holding fresh bread wrapped in foil.

KELL
The bakery's oven survived. Thought headquarters deserved tribute.

They laugh for the first time all night.

ARIA
(to the mic)
Red Creek, this is your morning check-in. You're not alone.

The ON AIR light steadies into a constant red glow.

CUT TO:

EXT. NORTH SHELTER GYM - AFTERNOON

Cots line a basketball court. Handwritten signs divide medicine, meals, and messages.
JUNE sets a portable recorder beside a whiteboard while ARIA interviews volunteers.
NOAH tunes a weather radio near the bleachers.

VOLUNTEER
Road twelve is open one lane. Bridge crew says no heavy trucks.

JUNE
Copy that. Spell your last name for the log.

VOLUNTEER
MARTINEZ. With a Z.

ARIA
(into recorder)
North shelter update, thirteen-forty local.

A TEENAGER approaches with a folded map and a list of missing pets.

TEENAGER
Can we broadcast this too?

JUNE
We can. Community board goes out every half hour.

NOAH raises a hand from the radio desk.

NOAH
Storm cell moved east. We have a clear window till sundown.

JUNE
Then we use every minute.

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - NIGHT

The studio wall is now covered with index cards: roads, meds, names, reunions.
KELL updates a chalkboard schedule while ARIA cues callers in a strict rotation.
NOAH closes one notebook and opens another marked DAY TWO.

KELL
We have three bakery shifts and one nurse asking for guitar requests.

ARIA
Tell the nurse she's first in the music block.

JUNE
(into mic)
Red Creek night bulletin. Roads six and twelve are passable with caution.

UNKNOWN VOICE (RADIO)
Copy, Red Creek. Sending thanks from the ridge crew.

The room pauses, listening to the quiet between transmissions.

NOAH
Remember when silence meant dead air?

JUNE
Now it means everyone made it through another hour.

ARIA slides a final card onto the board: REUNIONS CONFIRMED: 19.

KELL
Nineteen tonight. That's a record.

JUNE
Let's make room for twenty.

The ON AIR light burns steady as thunder fades far in the distance.
