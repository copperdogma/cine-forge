# Opening

.big, blue sky

A few clouds.  Sun gleaming.  Tilt down to:

Ext. Suburb - POV - day

Anywhere USA.  We are _in the POV_ of **NICK,** mid-20s and affable.

We walk down the

.front steps of Nick's house.

Birds chirp.  The sky is perfectly blue.

At the sidewalk, Nick takes a deep breath and pulls from his pocket a HAND-WRITTEN NOTE on lined paper.

He CLEARS HIS THROAT and

.reads OUT LOUD as he walks:

NICK
Laura, I’ve had a fairly mediocre life.  I went to a decent school, got a decent job.
Then I lost that job.  Now I'm working at the high school we both went to.  The same one where I utterly failed to tell you how I felt about you, that night on the hockey rink.

# !Shadow

Nick is so focused on the paper that he doesn't notice a LARGE SHADOW move across the street in front of him.

# Teacher's Salary...

NICK
My pathetic teacher's salary forced me to move back into my parents' house.  It almost feels like my life is moving backwards.  And I think about that night on the ice more than ever before.

# !Dog

A DOG runs by, BARKING, leash dragging behind it.

But Nick ignores it and walks on.

# And then you showed up...

NICK
And then, today, you showed up.  And I feel like I have a chance here to turn things around.  To get my life moving forward again.  If I can just do what I didn't do ten years ago.
If I can just ask you out on a date.

# !Lawn Mower

We walk past a half-mowed lawn.  The MOWER sits, engine running.  No owner in sight.

Again, we ignore this.  We're on a mission.

Even as DISTANT SIRENS and SKIDDING TIRES echo through the neighborhood.

# That's why I'm here...

NICK
So that's why I'm here.  And before you answer, I just want you to know that it's OK to say no.  Because what matters to me is that I finally had the balls to ask.
See, sometimes I get the feeling that I'm so wrapped up in my own stuff that I miss what's happening right in front of me.

# !F16 Flyby

.OVERHEAD

...three F16 FIGHTERS fly by in formation.  Nick/we pause to watch them pass.  Then back to the note:

NICK
I’ve always felt like I was destined for more.  So if I can do this, maybe it's the start of something bigger, something better for me.  For the both of us.  Who knows?

# !Car sucked into the air!

In our peripheral vision, a CAR is engulfed by some kind BLUE BEAM from the sky.  After a beat the car is _SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR_.

Nick misses it AGAIN.  But he does

.TURN TO LOOK

Looks up, down.  No car.  No nothing.

Hm.

Back to the paper:

# So whatever you say is fine...

NICK
So whatever you say is fine.  I've wanted to do this since that night -- and I think maybe you wanted me to too.

# !Alien Flyby

Overhead, in the distance, small flying craft fly by in formation.  But these are NOT JETS.

They are ALIEN SPACECRAFT.

But Nick -- God love him -- misses it.

# To too?

NICK
"To too?" That's awkward.

Shakes it off.

NICK
And so here I am at your door, hoping that ten years too late isn't -- too late.

He kind of skims the rest.

NICK
Laura, will you go out with me, etcetera etcetera.

He folds up the note and puts it back in his pocket.

Cracks his knuckles with nervous energy.  Injures himself.

NICK
Ow!

He shakes it off.  Stares up at

# Laura's House

.laura's house.

Behind it, STRANGE CLOUDS.  Whatever.

More SIRENS in the distance.

NICK
Don't say no.  Don't say no.  Don't say no.

And he walks up to the door.

NICK
(practicing)
Hi Laura.  Hi Laura!  Hello Laura.

Clears his throat again.  Places his hand on the doorbell.

DING...

.KABOOOOOOOOM!

_The house SHATTERS INTO A MILLION PEICES_!

LASER BEAMS blast through the splintering wood all around us!  We duck, stumbling backwards.

We/Nick are on our backside, covered in DEBRIS.  We look up.

.The house is DESTROYED.

Where it sat is now OPEN SKY, filled with

.A GIGANTIC, EVIL FLYING SAUCER

...which rains fiery hell down on earth in all directions.

At the center of the ship is a TRACTOR BEAM.

_And in that tractor beam is LAURA_.

We just barely see her getting sucked away.  Flailing, screaming:

LAURA
Nick!  NICK!

Nick/we pause for a moment, stunned.

The ship begins to pull away, slowly.  Then faster.

And we do the only thing we know how to do.

===

We get up.

And RUN.

.toward the ship.

FREEZE FRAME on flailing arms and legs and a distant spaceship over a scorched Earth.
