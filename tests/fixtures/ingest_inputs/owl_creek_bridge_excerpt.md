# An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (Excerpt)

Source text: Project Gutenberg eBook #375 (public domain in the U.S.).

A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift water twenty feet below. The man's hands were behind his back, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck and was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head. Some loose boards laid upon the ties supplied a footing for him and his executioners, two private soldiers of the Federal army.

Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then curving was lost to view. The other bank of the stream was open ground topped with a stockade of vertical tree trunks, and midway up the slope stood a single company of infantry in line. Excepting the small group at the center of the bridge, not a man moved.
