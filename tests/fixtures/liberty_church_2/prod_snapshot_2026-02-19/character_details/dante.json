She is a newly hired broker-in-training at BEL Inc. in 1997 Manhattan, driven by a traumatic childhood marked by domestic violence and poverty. Fiercely ambitious, street-smart, and emotionally guarded, she is determined to achieve wealth and power so that no one can ever harm or control her again. She is simultaneously raw and resilient, navigating a brutal, chauvinistic financial world while concealing her vulnerabilities behind wit, bravado, and calculated self-control.","dialogue_summary":"Dante's dialogue moves between three registers: guarded ambition (her interview answers about wanting power and wealth), social navigation (attempting to charm or deflect the brokers, warming to Greta and Liliane), and raw vulnerability (her drunken confession to Abe about her family and past). She is often reactive rather than expository, revealing character through action and brief, pointed lines rather than monologue. Her most defining spoken moments are her interview declaration of wanting to be 'somebody nobody can fuck with,' her heel-throwing quip to the trading floor, and her whispered threat to Joaquin in the men's bathroom. Her phone call in the washroom early in the day reveals an unguarded, joyful side she otherwise suppresses. Her drunken cab ride home exposes exhaustion, self-doubt, and dark humor about her origins.","explicit_evidence":[{"quote":"Because I want to be rich. I want to be powerful.
