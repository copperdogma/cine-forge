He is introduced in a disheveled and incapacitated state — face down at a desk with a wet pant leg — suggesting he had an accident (likely urinated on himself). Despite this, he is present at the VIP celebration later, where he is quiet, delayed in his reactions, and communicates minimally, primarily in Russian. He appears to have been instrumental in closing a significant deal ('Cane Deeds'), suggesting he holds a meaningful professional role despite his erratic personal state.","dialogue_summary":"Yuri speaks only twice, both times in Russian. In the first scene, he mumbles 'Boobies' while grabbing at Greta's breasts as she helps him up. In the second scene, he responds 'Good!' with a thumbs up when Joaquin mocks him.
