He begins with deferential compliance ('Yes, sir.'), then asserts his honesty when accused of double-charging ('No, Miss. Nobody paid me.'). He gently checks on Dante's wellbeing ('Can I ask, are you okay?') and offers an unsolicited cultural reflection on male responsibility toward women. His dialogue is calm, accented, and dignified throughout, contrasting sharply with Dante's slurred aggression.","explicit_evidence":[{"quote":"The cabbie (ARMAN) is a well-manicured, AFGHAN MALE in his 40s.","source_scene":"EXT.
