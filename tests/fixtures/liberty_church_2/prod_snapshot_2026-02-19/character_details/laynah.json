She is territorial, status-conscious, and openly hostile toward newcomers she perceives as threats, particularly Dante. She operates within the firm's boys-club culture, performing femininity and compliance when it serves her (e.g., entertaining clients) while wielding social cruelty as a power tool against other women.","dialogue_summary":"Laynah's dialogue is consistently hostile, self-serving, or performative. She opens by privately branding Dante 'Dominican street trash,' then challenges Abe's hiring decision using misogynistic language she has absorbed from the firm's culture. In the corridor she feigns warmth while immediately pivoting to steal credit for Daniels' account. On the trading floor she frames a humiliating 'welcome gift' (a disheveled Yuri) as a joke at Dante's expense. In the VIP room she inserts herself into the group, deflects Joaquin's groping with mild irritation, and fails to register Dante's genuine attempt at female solidarity.","explicit_evidence":[{"quote":"LAYNAH, a 30-something broad-shouldered, fake-breasted broker dressed in high-end country club wear.","source_scene":"INT.
