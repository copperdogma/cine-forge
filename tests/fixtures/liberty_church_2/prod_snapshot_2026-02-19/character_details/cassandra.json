She is a senior power broker at BEL Inc., occupying a position of authority above the trading floor. She is impeccably presented, minimalistic in her workspace aesthetic, and operates with a commanding, no-nonsense demeanor that occasionally cracks to reveal warmth and even vulnerability. She is a self-appointed mentor to Dante, guiding her with blunt, sometimes brutal honesty, and is clearly a dominant force in the male-dominated office environment.","dialogue_summary":"Cassandra's dialogue is commanding, blunt, and often simultaneously directed at multiple people or situations (she frequently speaks while on the phone). In the interview scene she asks probing, direct questions. At the bar she delivers a brutal but motivating critique of Dante's appearance and a frank warning about the office's misogyny, framing herself as Dante's necessary ally. At Saks she issues terse directives to Liliane while conducting business calls. Her parting words to Dante outside Saks are cryptic and controlling ('don't ask, don't tell'). In the VIP room she arrives triumphant and celebratory, announcing she has secured the Cane account. Her speech patterns are clipped, declarative, and authoritative, with occasional moments of dry wit.","explicit_evidence":[{"quote":"I said, I will handle it. This one is mine.
