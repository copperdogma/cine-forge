She possesses a wholesome beauty, a perma-smile, and a sing-song voice. Her desk area is decorated in yellow and feels like a country home. She is the emotional and logistical backbone of the office, nurturing new employees, managing chaos with grace, and maintaining warm relationships with even the most unruly brokers.","dialogue_summary":"Greta's dialogue is warm, instructional, and maternal. She guides Dante through the office with a sing-song narration of company culture, rules, and personalities. She introduces Dante to the brokers with playful affection, defuses tension with humor, and offers genuine emotional support. Her speech is peppered with diminutives ('Oopsies!', 'shall we?', 'love') and gentle authority. She also serves as a conduit for Abe's instructions, relaying reservation requests and office logistics without complaint. Her most revealing line — 'You will' (in response to Dante saying she doesn't smoke) — hints at a knowing, slightly fatalistic wisdom about the office's effect on people.","explicit_evidence":[{"quote":"You come and see me if you need anything.
