The character represents the collective crude, sexually charged, and rowdy culture of the brokerage floor. Two distinct lines are attributed to 'BROKER' as a label, suggesting either two different unnamed brokers or a composite voice of the pit crowd. Both lines are directed at Dante on her first day, showcasing the office's culture of sexual harassment masked as camaraderie.","dialogue_summary":"BROKER delivers two lines, both directed at Dante during her introduction to the trading floor. The first contextualizes the group's crude sexual pantomime as an expression of affection ('This is how we show our love around here, Dante!'). The second escalates to an explicit demand to see Dante's breasts. Both lines serve to establish the toxic, hyper-masculine culture of the brokerage floor rather than to develop an individual character.","explicit_evidence":[{"quote":"This is how we show our love around here, Dante!","source_scene":"INT.
