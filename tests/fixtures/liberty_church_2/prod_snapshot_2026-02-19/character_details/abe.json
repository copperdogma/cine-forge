He is one of three senior interviewers/executives at BEL Inc., exuding an aura of commanding authority, refined elegance, and barely concealed volatility. He is impeccably dressed, stone-faced in professional settings, and operates with a practiced, almost theatrical control over every interaction. He possesses an uncanny ability to read people, which he leverages as both a professional and personal weapon. Beneath his polished exterior lies a man capable of sudden, explosive outbursts, crude humor, and psychological manipulation, yet also moments of surprising warmth and candor.","dialogue_summary":"Abe's dialogue is a masterclass in controlled dominance punctuated by sudden volatility. In the interview scene, he poses a morally ambiguous hit-and-run question with cold precision. In his office, he performs a high-pressure broker call with practiced theatricality, using a punching bag and fake frenzy to manipulate a client. At the bar, he oscillates between warm mentor and terrifying authority figure — sharing a genuine childhood story about his people-reading gift, then pivoting to explosive outbursts about power and wealth, crude anatomical humor, and finally a psychological game about identifying a one-testicled colleague. His speech patterns are characterized by deliberate pacing, rhetorical repetition for emphasis, and a tendency to interrupt others mid-sentence. He issues commands disguised as invitations and delivers rules as non-negotiable edicts.","explicit_evidence":[{"quote":"Without breaking his eye-contact with Dante, Abe raises one 'enough' finger to Joaquin.","source_scene":"INT.
