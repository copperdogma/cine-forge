His mother is a Newfoundlander, and he frequently adopts a Newfoundland accent when cracking jokes, which is most of the time. He is one of three senior interviewers/partners at BEL Inc., affluently dressed and commanding in the office. He is boisterous, crude, sexually inappropriate, and relentlessly humorous in social settings, but reveals a darker, more threatening and volatile side when under the influence of cocaine.","dialogue_summary":"Joaquin's dialogue is relentlessly loud, crude, and joke-driven, frequently deploying his Newfoundland accent for comedic effect. He uses vulgar nicknames, sexual innuendo, and physical humor to dominate social situations. In professional settings he is terse and pointed. His most revealing dialogue occurs in the washroom, where cocaine strips away his comedic persona and exposes a coercive, racist, and sexually threatening man who attempts to leverage Dante's vulnerability for personal gain. After being physically subdued by Dante, he resorts to calling her a 'bitch' and then publicly ejects her from the bar.","explicit_evidence":[{"quote":"You havin' a seizure?
