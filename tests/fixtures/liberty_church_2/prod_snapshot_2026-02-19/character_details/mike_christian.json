He is one of the more grounded and socially aware members of the broker group, serving as an informal interpreter and mediator. While he participates in the crude office culture, he does so with more restraint and self-awareness than his peers, often acting as a bridge between the chaotic environment and newcomers like Dante.","dialogue_summary":"Mike Christian's dialogue spans two main contexts: the pit introduction and the VIP booth gathering. In the pit, he joins the chaotic welcome for Dante with an exaggerated sexual outburst. In the booth, he is more measured — pressing Dante for Abe's secret, volunteering his own crude self-disclosure ('9 inches'), and repeatedly serving as a cultural interpreter for Joaquin's Newfoundland dialect and the firm's unspoken norms. His speech patterns are direct, confident, and occasionally conspiratorial, positioning himself as a knowledgeable insider and ally.","explicit_evidence":[{"quote":"Seriously?
