He is one of three senior interviewers/partners at BEL Inc., affluently dressed and commanding in the office. He is boisterous, crude, sexually inappropriate, and relentlessly humorous in social settings, but reveals a darker, more threatening and volatile side when under the influence of cocaine.",

It's where she emerges from a luxury shopping experience, physically transformed with new clothes and heels, and receives Cassandra's final cryptic instructions ('don't ask, don't tell'). The location symbolizes the intersection of luxury and urban reality, and represents Dante's transition point - she's been made over but is now left alone to navigate her new identity. The busy, indifferent city backdrop emphasizes her isolation despite her transformation, while the 'glorious winter day' suggests possibility and new beginnings. The location captures the moment where Dante shifts from being guided to being independent, 'strangely empowered' despite confusion.",

DINGY MOTEL ROOM - LATE DAY\n\nA SMALL FIGURE quickly scampers to a CHAIR in a corner of the room. We continue to hear yelling and things being thrown around the room.\n\nThe light from the setting sun is coming through the MOTEL room WINDOW and hits the face of the small figure. We see YOUNG DANTE with dark hair and big brown, frightened eyes.\n\nSMACK--\n\nThe little girl sees DANTE'S MOTHER (30s, Latina, fragile yet tough) head hit the floor in front of her. Her mother is lying on her side with her eyes wide open and looking up at the little girl. A trickle of blood starts trailing down her jawline from her ear. Her eyes are scared yet attempting reassurance.\n\nThe little girl appears frozen in a trance as she looks down on her mother.\n\nYOUNG DANTE\nUno... Dos... Tres...\n\nThe sun illuminates behind DANTE'S FATHER (30s, Haitian, large and scary) as his shadowy figure looks up to the little girl. He puts a finger to his lips and walks out.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\n--we hear the little girl's voice morph into the voice of a woman counting in a whisper in her head.\n\nDANTE (V.O., CONT'D)\n... Quatro... Cinco... Seis...\n\nFADE IN:\n\n\nINT. BEL INC. OFFICE, WINTER, 1997 - JUST BEFORE DAWN\n\nWe see a man's lower jaw and mouth moving while talking.\nThe counting appears to be for the man's teeth.\n\nDANTE (V.O., CONT'D)\n... Siete... Ocho... Nueve...\n\nWe are looking at the patterns of a woman's dress.\nThen, to a woman's mouth moving. No sound, until...\n\nCASSANDRA\n... Dante?\n\nCASSANDRA (late-30s woman, well-put together and stern). She has a borderline English accent, but she was born and raised here, in Manhattan.\n\nDANTE (V.O.)\nYes. Ummm...\n\nJOAQUIN\nYou havin' a seizure? You wanna borrow Cassandra's ball gag so you don't swallow your tongue?\n\nJOAQUIN is a chubby, short, half-bald with a burnt hair comb-over male in his 50s). His mother is a Newfoundlander, and he often uses the accent when cracking jokes, which is most of the time.\n\nA third set of eyes is looking at the woman. This is ABE, a chronically tired, highly manicured 'silver fox' in his 50s.\n\nThey are all affluently dressed and in 3 expensive leather office chairs.\n\nAcross from these 3 figures is DANTE (mid-late 20s stunning woman with milk chocolate skin).\n\nThe room is slightly dark in these last moments before dawn. There is nothing else in the room but a window and a FIERY PAINTING worth more than most people's homes, behind the interviewers.\n\nWithout breaking his eye-contact with Dante, Abe raises one 'enough' finger to Joaquin.\n\nABE\nI will repeat the question this once. If you ran over someone on your way to work, would you stop, or would you keep going?\n\nDANTE\nI would keep going.\n\nJOAQUIN\nYou got human fucking blood all over your grill. You keep going?\n\nDANTE\nNo. I would stop first. I would see how they are.\n\nDante's eyes dart frantically to all the interviewers.\n\nABE\nAnd if stopping would cause you to miss the market opening in London...?\n\nJOAQUIN\nYou just whammed someone, and you're shitfaced. You think it's wise to stop?\n\nDANTE\nWell, no, not if I was going to be late. I would keep going if I was going to be late...\n(beat; confused)\nI'm on my way to work?\n\nJOAQUIN\nExactly.\n\nJoaquin sits back. All is quiet and all 3 are staring at Dante.\n\nCASSANDRA\nDante. Honey. Why exactly do you want to work for BEL? Be honest.\n\nA beat between Cassandra and Dante. Dante takes a large breath and refocuses. Somewhat practiced...\n\nDANTE\nBecause I want to be rich. I want to be powerful.\n(beat)\nBecause I want to be somebody that nobody can fuck with.\n\nSilence. The 3 interviewers are staring at her. Cassandra and Joaquin smile. Abe remains stone-faced.\n\nThe sun begins to rise, and the dawn light pours in, illuminating Dante's face.\n\nEND OF TEASER\n\nACT ONE\n\n\nINT. BEL INC. EMPTY WASHROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\nMarble everything. Gold fixtures gleam under soft lighting.\nAs we FADE IN, we hear excited squealing.\n\nDANTE (INTO PHONE)\nI got it!\n\nShe is speaking excitedly in non-sequiturs.\n\nDANTE (CONT'D)\nI only have a minute 'cause\nI'm about to have a tour\naround my new office. Ahh!\nI've never been so happy!\n\nCARAJO... WHAT A GRUELING\nprocess. This one was nothing\nlike the other two. It was\njust... weird. I... I can't\nbelieve I got it after\nthat... I just need these\nnext two years... Ah! I'm\ncalling you on my new\nCELLPHONE!\n\nDante is awkwardly holding a brand-new giant MOTOROLA.\nShe is smiling and brimming over with joy.\n\nDANTE (CONT'D)\n(into phone)\nYah, I tried to do what you\nsaid, but I was so\n\nNERVOUS... I JUST BLANKED--\n(beat)\nYou know, it seemed like\nCassandra had the final say.\nShe's the one who pulled me\naside after the interview to\ntell me I was hired --\n\nDante is listening intently.\n\nDANTE (CONT'D)\n(into phone)\n-- oh yah, Abe. Yah, I\n\nFINALLY MET HIM.\n(laughs and whispers)\nHe is a pencil-necked prick--\n\nDante's sentence is interrupted by a woman walking into\nthe bathroom. It is LAYNAH, a 30-something broad-\nshouldered, fake-breasted broker dressed in high-end\ncountry club wear.\n\nDANTE\nHi\n\nLaynah looks her up and down and shoots her a murderous\nglare while heading to a stall.\n\nShe turns her back and covers the phone receiver with\nher hand. She resumes listening.\n\nDANTE (CONT'D)\n(whispering into phone)\n\nI DON'T KNOW.\n(beat)\n\nIN THE OFFICE BATHROOM.\n(beat)\n\nDante looks up to a small mirror mounted in the top corner\nof the bathroom. (*Note: We won't know this until later,\nbut this is a camera that Abe and Joaquin watch\nregularly.)\n\nDANTE (CONT'D)\n(whispers)\nFuck.\n\nShe hears a muffled sniff coming from the stall at the\nsame time the toilet flushes.\n\nDante turns to the mirror and looks at herself in full.\nOver it, PRELAP:\n\nLAYNAH (V.O.)\nWho the HELL is that\nDominican street trash?\n\n\nINT. ABE'S OFFICE - MORNING\n\nWe see Laynah, jaw grinding and enraged.\n\nAbe is at his desk reading documents and listening to a constant stream of news radio through an EAR BUD. He doesn't look up.\n\nAdorning the wall behind him is a giant PAINTING of a storming ocean. His desk is sprawling and elegant with DOCUMENTS and NEWSPAPERS neatly stacked in various piles. We see his PAGER and BEEPER side by side at the corner of the desk. The office is stunning, pristine, and nothing short of regal.\n\nLAYNAH (CONT'D)\nI thought we had a freeze on hiring more women. Something about 'bleeding, cramps and no more mat leave'?\n\nAbe's phone starts to ring. It is at his ear before the ring ends.\n\nGRETA (V.O.)\nDunaway needs your help with Mr. Daniels, sir.\n\nAbe knows exactly what this means. Without looking at her, he puts his finger up to Laynah, and points to the small, leather LOVE SEAT at the back of the room.\n\nABE\n(into phone)\nCount to 30 and connect me.\n\nAbe cradles the phone and presses 'hold'.\n\nWe see Laynah sit down in a huff, drumming her false nails on the fine leather.\n\nAbe jumps up and runs to the corner of his office where we see a PUNCHING BAG. He intensely pounds off a few rounds.\n\nOn his way back, he turns the STEREO on and cranks the volume. It is the frenzied sound of brokers. He goes to the phone and answers completely out of breath with voice racing. He starts pacing.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\n(panting into phone)\nSteven! Steve...\n\nAbe is listening impatiently. STEVEN DANIELS is a long-time client of Abe's. Always second-guessing and backing out of deals, he needs a LOT of reassurance. Abe knows exactly how to play him.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\n(yelling into phone)\nYes. Yes. I understand. You need to calm down Steve. Listen, the London numbers are out, and the market is tanking. The employment numbers came out (panting)... they are weak, and they are low. Now prices are getting jacked up because the storm and power outages have been pooling energy over. EVERYONE is shorting their stock. All my brokers are here early to clean this fucking mess up. We need to get everyone's tickets in the second the market opens.\n(holds phone to stereo)\n\nWe hear the frantic, muffled voice of Steven Daniels on the other line. Abe brings the phone back to his ear. We notice a practiced cadence to Abe's speech.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\n(into phone)\nSteve, the longer you hold on to the position the worse it will be. Hold on. Let me go to my desk and get out of this frenzy.\n(slowly turns down volume)\nListen. You either get rid of those shares now, or they will be as worthless as a used fucking condom. Are you listening to me? No one will want to buy them. Do you enjoy high quality toilet paper, Daniels? Do you? Tell me. Because if you do, these shares are about to become the most expensive shit tickets you have ever owned. Hell, if you like them so much, we can get you more and give your ass the royal treatment it deserves!\n\nLaynah muffles a laugh. Abe's eyes flicker up to her. She quickly wipes the smile off her face. We hear Daniels' muffled rambling again.\n\nAbe sits back down at his desk and reaches for a BLANK TICKET while listening.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\n(into phone)\nSteven, you sound like you need some relax time. Listen, I'll dump your shares, and then we'll all go out for a nice night on the town tomorrow to celebrate. We'll end up at Flashdancers--\n\nHe looks back up to Laynah.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\n(into phone)\n-- in fact, why don't I have one of my girls pick you up an hour before...\n\nLaynah is pleading 'no' with her eyes. He doesn't react to her.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\n(into phone)\n... to help you wind down.\n(beat)\nExcellent. Done deal. 7pm, tomorrow. We'll start at I'Tremeli. I'll have our people let the banks know the second the market opens. You made the right call Steven. See you then.\n\nAs Abe hangs up, he starts writing the ticket. A painfully long silence occurs in the room.\n\nABE\nFirst, although it is none of your business, she is not hired. When have we ever hired at the 3rd interview?\n\nLAYNAH\nWe haven't --\n\nABE\n-- Yes. We haven't. Ever. Lastly, 6pm tomorrow, be at Steven Daniels' house. Look slutty --\n(MORE)\n\nABE (CONT'D)\n(looks up and re-considers)\n\n-- ER.\nAnd don't wear one of your JAP-y Bar Mitzvah dresses.\n\nLaynah gets up to leave.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nOh, and tell Greta to make the reso. And take this ticket to Crooked Tits.\n\nAs Abe is giving Laynah the ticket, we see, through the slightly ajar door, the back of Dante and a very curvy blonde woman stopped in front.\n\nDante turns and looks at Abe. There is a beat between them. Abe looks back down to his business at hand.\n\n\nINT. 3RD FLOOR CORRIDOR - MORNING - CONTINUOUS\n\nGRETA (GREATNESS), 40s, the office manager (but more like office mother), and her sweet perma-smile, are touring Dante around the building. She has a wholesome beauty about her. In her sing-song voice:\n\nGRETA\n(pointing to the bottom floor)\nNow, Abe has 2 offices--\n\nBAM! Laynah collides with Dante's back.\n\nDANTE\nOops! Sorry...\n\nAs Dante turns, her and Laynah have a beat between them.\n\nGRETA\nOh, wonderful timing! I was just touring around our newest broker-in-training, Dante...\n(looking to Dante)\nDe La Cruz?\n(Dante nods)\nThis is Laynah. She is a wonderfully motivated and--\n\nLaynah's scowl has turned into a large, fake and tight smile. She postures for Dante. Her voice is irritating.\n\nLAYNAH\n(overlapping her)\n--we met in the washroom. Didn't we? You were talking on the phone.\n(tight smile)\nWell, I'm very busy.\n(holding up the ticket)\nWelcome to the family... Dante.\n\nLaynah turns on her heel and leaves.\n\nDANTE\nThank you. Nice to meet--\n\nLAYNAH\n(overlapping)\n--oh, and Greta...\n(Laynah turns back)\n... Abe wants to take me out for dinner tomorrow night, with Mr. Daniels, to thank me for helping save his account. Make reservations for 3 at I'Tremeli. 7pm.\n\nLaynah quickly rushes off.\n\nGreta smiles sweetly at Dante and puts her arm in hers.\n\nGRETA\nWell, Cassandra has requested that I set you up in your new home before the market opens, so, let's get this tour going, shall we?\n\nDante looks back at Abe. His back is now turned to her, and he is on the phone.\n\nGRETA (CONT'D)\nSpeaking of whom, guess who is next?\n\nGreta ushers her forward. Cassandra is on the phone.\n\nGRETA (CONT'D)\nOopsie! It's best not to disturb her right now.\n\nThey walk past an art-deco white DESK with fine lines. The area is impeccably clean and minimalistic. Any office necessity that you do see is made of clean steel, glass, or is white. Even the TELEVISION is beautiful.\n\nCassandra is at this desk, on her COMPUTER, on her PHONE, watching the morning news, checking her PAGER and half-watching the transaction that just occurred.\n\nCASSANDRA\n(firmly into the phone)\nI said, I will handle it. This one is mine. Trust me.\n\nWe hear Abe in the adjacent office hanging up his phone a moment before Cassandra.\n\nPrelap:\n\nWe hear loud whirring and the sound of dial up internet.\n\n\nINT. CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF I.T. DESKS - MORNING\n\nGreta and Dante are standing in front of 2 incredibly messy desks in a room full of half-repaired COMPUTERS, SYSTEM UNITS, PRINTERS, SCREENS, CORDS, WIRES -- I.T. heaven.\n\nGRETA\nHere we have some of our hardest workers. Our I.T. gentleman are here from dusk 'til dawn. If you have any technical questions, these are the brilliant minds to ask.\n\nShe raises her voice towards the men.\n\nGRETA (CONT'D)\nGentleman, this is Dante.\n\nDante nods in hello at what appears to be the stocky guy (JOHN) and the lanky guy (TENNESSEE). Both look like they haven't seen the light of day for years.\n\nTennessee looks up from one of the desks quickly and skittishly looks away while typing. John looks up from his desk, lingers, and winks. He has 4 opened SAUCES in front of him and is eating an EGG MCMUFFIN. The sauce is all over his chin and shirt.\n\nGreta beams at them.\n\nGRETA (CONT'D)\n\nTHAT IS TENNESSEE...\n... and John.\n\nDANTE\nNice to meet you both.\n\nJOHN\n(lewdly sucking the sauce off his Mc Muffin)\n\nHI DANTE. THOR.\n(motions to himself)\n\nAs they continue around the square of the corridor, Dante looks down towards the center of the office.\n\nThis is the pit. It is where all the brokers and board people work. It is full of TV SCREENS, PHONES, and large PC COMPUTERS appended on top of large pillars. The massive CLOCK in the middle of the room has NYC written on top and reads 8:30am. The office has been relatively quiet up until now, save for a few brokers reading the Wall Street Journal quietly at their desks, as other employees start to file in for the day.\n\nGreta starts quickly pointing out who is who to Dante.\n\nGRETA\nAh, here come some of the brokers. That is Dunaway, Mike, Paul... another Mike...\n\nMIKE THE SHIT, (tall, 30-something broker with a temper), and PAUL 'BIG WILLIE', (humpty-dumpty man in his 50s), are snorting laughing. They seem drunk. They look up to see the two ladies. Mike bends Paul over the desk and pretends to butt fuck him. They switch and Paul pretends to butt fuck Mike. When they are finished, they start stretching as though just waking up.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\n(loudly)\nAhhhh... thanks buddy. Ready for the day.\n\nThey high five each other and head to their desks, acting like it is just normal routine.\n\nGRETA\n(laughing)\nThose two are such hams! Don't pay any mind to them Dante, they just love to make us laugh. You'll be sitting just above Mike actually.\n\nThere is more filing in, but Greta keeps walking towards the stairway to the trading pit.\n\nDante is visibly nervous. Greta softly, yet firmly, puts a hand on Dante's arm.\n\nGRETA (CONT'D)\nYes... you'll be starting out right down there.\n(pointing to the floor just above Mike, who is now downing a bottle of PEPTO BISMAL)\nDunaway will help you get started for the first month or so and --\n\nCassandra walks up and interrupts Greta's tour.\n\nCASSANDRA\n-- Pardon me for interrupting Greta. May I steal Dante away?\n\nGreta is always accommodating.\n\nGRETA\nOf course, Cassandra. We can finish our tour later.\n(turning to Dante and taking her hands)\nYou come and see me if you need anything. Ok? I mean that. Anything at all, I am here for you.\n\nGreta gives Dante a huge hug and hands her coat back to her.\n\nDANTE\nThank you, Greta. You are so kind.\n\nGreta nods and then walks down the stairs towards the pit. A few of the guys yell out \"GREATNESSSSSS!\". She is smiling at them and saying her good mornings.\n\nCASSANDRA\nI thought that maybe you and I could get a little breakfast. Are you peckish?\n\nDANTE\nYes, I am.\n(beat)\nIs it ok... for me to just go?\n\nCASSANDRA\nEverything is always okay when you are with me. Besides, the market is going to be dead for a while. Did you get your office phone?\n\nDante digs in her cheap PURSE and presents her new Motorola phone that Greta gave her earlier. We note Cassandra looking at her purse with disgust.\n\nThey smile at each other.\n\nCASSANDRA\nWonderful. Be sure to have it on you at all times. We can head out this way.\n\nThey head to the top floor and toward the elevator.\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\n(yelling to the board person just arriving)\nMake sure you page any calls from Cane straight to my cell phone. No ifs, ands, or buts.\n(beat)\nAnd keep that JAP bitch off my clients!\n\nCassandra places a KEY in a brass wall panel of the elevator and turns it. The elevator 'dings' with the same sound as a cash register.\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\n(slightly embarrassed)\nJoaquin.\n\nThe elevator doors open and it is stunning and ornate. The music is Baroque opera. Other than mirrors on all walls, it resembles the Sistine Chapel. Dante's face reflects her awe.\n\nCassandra has a small look of satisfaction on her face as she presses 'G'. We see on the panel that one of the floors has KEY ACCESS only.\n\nWe hear the 'cash register ding' again as we watch the thick, embossed brass elevator doors close.\n\n\nINT. GEMINI'S BAR - 8:35AM - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe doors open into a quiet, empty and low-lit bar. It\nis full of deep mahogany wood and plush, red leather\nBOOTHS. We see that the front door is closed, and the\nwindow shades are drawn. It is clearly before opening\nhours, yet a lone bartender looks up in greeting.\n\nEMMA, (plain woman in her 20s), smiles at them and\nimmediately grabs a REMOTE CONTROL to turn on the\nmusic (hyper-beat French Techno), and all the TVs. The\nTVs are all set to various news channels. She takes\neverything down to a low volume. Emma does anything\nthe brokers tell her to as they take care of her very\nwell.\n\nThey take a seat at the wood, and the Emma is over\nimmediately. Cassandra places her pager and beeper\nbeside her hand and checks it periodically when Dante\nis speaking.\n\nCASSANDRA\n(to Dante)\nWould you like a juice?\n(to Emma)\n\nTWO BREAKFAST JUICES EMMA.\n(to Dante)\nI apologize for how stressful those interviews can be. It's\nnice to be able to talk with you in a more relaxed\natmosphere. How are you feeling thus far?\n\nDANTE\nGood. Very good.\n\nCASSANDRA\nYou look petrified Dante. Don't lie to me. Are you scared?\n\nDANTE\nNo, no. I'm very excited.\n\nTheir 'breakfast juices' arrive and Cassandra\nimmediately takes out a perfectly folded, CLOTH\nNAPKIN from her purse, wipes the rim, and shoots hers\nback. Dante is watching and follows suit almost\nspitting it out as is it basically orange-tinted\npure alcohol.\n\nDANTE (CONT'D)\n(small choke)\nI am very grateful to be working for this company. It\nwas really nice of you to vouch --\n\nWhile gazing at Dante, Cassandra takes 2 fingers and\ntaps the bar, much akin to \"hit me\" in '21'.\n\nCASSANDRA\n(over)\n--listen, Dante. You should be scared if your plan is to\nmake it alone. You had but a glimpse of the boy's club up\nthere. It is ferocious and chauvinistic to the extreme.\nThose men are skin hungry pigs.\n(beat while looking at Dante)\nI am going to help you.\n\nThe next 2 breakfast juices arrive. Cassandra wipes the\nrim again and shoots her drink. Dante follows suit. She\nis eying Dante up and down.\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\nFirst off, throw out that ridiculous perfume you are\nwearing. It's fake, d\u00e9class\u00e9, and it stunk up the entire\noffice. Even the stench of Laynah's twat rot can't\n(MORE)\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\noverpower that crap. Second, you need new hair. Right now,\nit looks like a nest with a rat's tail sewn into it.\nYour make-up... did Tammy Faye Bakker come out with a new\nJ.C. Penny line? Do me a favor and don't show up in\nyour fucking Mexican prom dress tomorrow. And we need\nto work on your poker face ...\nDo you need to fart?\n\nDante strained smile appears stuck in position.\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\nNow, I have been looking for a strong, intelligent,\nattractive woman to join forces with...\n\nCassandra looks Dante up and down. She taps the bar\nagain with 2 fingers with her eyes steady on Dante,\nassessing.\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\n... and this company is suffering from great\n\nDEFICIENCIES IN THAT DEPARTMENT.\n(beat)\nBut I think you are moldable.\n\nDante looks scared and uneasy. Cassandra is watching the\nbartender approach.\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\nI need you to cut this scared little girl shit and pull it\n\nTOGETHER.\n(beat)\nYou were hired because I have a good feeling about you,\nDante. I need you to trust me and do what I say. Always. Do\nexactly what I say.\n\nTwo more breakfast juices arrive. Cassandra taps the\nbar again with 2 fingers and makes a 'cut off' line\nwith her index finger.\n\nDANTE\nShould we get some menus?\n\nThe bartender laughs quietly to herself and walks\naway. Cassandra wipes the rim, shoots her drink, as\ndoes Dante again. Cassandra maintains her composure as\nthough she's had nothing to drink. Dante is already\nbeginning to show her state.\n\nCASSANDRA\nFood contaminates the mind. Now... I have a friend on 5th\nAvenue who can get you started. Let's consider this a\nwelcome gift. From me to you.\n\nDante has no idea what she is talking about. Two more\ndrinks arrive. The bartender walks off. Cassandra wipes\nthe rim and turns to Dante. She holds up her drink with\na smile.\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\nYour face Dante, relax your face. To the start of a\nstinking rich partnership.\n\nBefore Dante can respond, Cassandra has shot her\ndrink, stood up and is turning to leave.\n\nDante drinks and watches Cassandra walking away.\nCassandra turns and slaps the top of her hip once.\nWith that, Dante scrambles up from her seat and\nheads towards Cassandra.\n\nThe somewhat blurry Emma is helping a couple of new\narrivals that she recognizes from the trading floor.\nEmma looks up, smiles and waves, and starts making her\nway around the bar. She gestures to encourage Dante to\nleave with Cassandra quickly. Dante smiles and turns\nto exit.\n\nTHUD! The door shuts in her face.\n\n\nEXT. GEMINI'S BAR - STREET - CONTINUOUS\n\nCassandra is on her cell phone and hailing a cab outside, not looking back for Dante. It is cold and gray.\n\nThe exterior bar door opens, and Dante is scurrying towards her. Dante quickly notices that she forgot her coat on the bar stool and quickly turns back to grab her coat...\n\nTHUD! CLICK! The door closes and locks behind her. As she goes to knock, she hears Cassandra slap the side of the cab loudly. Dante turns and hurries towards the CAB.\n\nEND OF ACT ONE\n\nACT TWO\n\n\nEXT. SAK'S FIFTH AVE - MORNING\n\nA yellow taxi pulls up in front of Sak's Fifth Ave.\n\nCassandra and Dante step out of the cab. Cassandra is on the phone, and Dante looks like a kid in a candy store.\n\nCassandra hangs up her phone call as they head towards the front door.\n\n\nEXT. SAK'S FIFTH AVE FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe Saks Fifth Avenue sales manager smiling in greeting.\n\nLILIANE, (slight, 60-something, exquisitely coiffed female), is from the pre-plastic surgery generation and wears her age gracefully. She is gracious, kind and accommodating to her rich clients. She looks Dante up and down and smiles quaintly.\n\nLILIANE\nI trust this visit is for\nyour new friend, Cassandra?\n\nCassandra smiles. Liliane unlocks and opens the door.\n\nLILIANE (CONT'D)\nAfter you, ladies.\n\nCassandra slips in quickly. As Dante walks in, she attempts to cover her awe. Liliane locks the door again behind them.\n\nCASSANDRA\nLiliane, this is Dante. Dante\nis a new broker at the firm.\n\nPLEASE HAVE HER APPEARANCE\nreflect this.\n\nCassandra passes Liliane her BLACK VISA CARD. Dante looks from Cassandra to Liliane with bewilderment.\n\nLILIANE\nOf course, Ms. Constantine.\nIt will be my absolute\npleasure.\n\nWhile dialing the phone, Cassandra pauses to look up at Dante.\n\nCASSANDRA\nHave fun.\n\nLiliane takes Dante's arm in hers and leads her down the hall. They stop at a wall near the front entrance and Liliane opens a steel box with a key from her GIANT KEY RING. She flicks on the light switches inside. The entire store illuminates further and they enter the adjacent elevator.\n\nMuch like the shopping scenes in Pretty Women, there are various montages of Liliane dressing Cassandra in beautiful CLOTHING, SHOES, MAKE-UP, and even attempts to re-style Dante's hair.\n\nCassandra is there, on the phone the entire time, approving or disapproving everything. All that she approves would be considered incredibly provocative.\n\nDante comes out with her final make-over and truly looks like a high-end prostitute.\n\nCASSANDRA\n\nCLIENT ENTERTAINING OUTFIT.\n\nMEMORIZE THIS.\n(into phone)\nFucktard, I told you to not\nlet that JAP bitch talk to\nCane.\n\nDante comes out with a provocative yet conservative outfit.\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\n\nOFFICE-WEAR. YOU CAN KEEP\n\nTHAT ONE ON.\n(somewhat to herself)\n\nJOAQUIN WILL APPRECIATE THIS\n\nONE.\n(into phone)\nNo, not you. Listen, I am\ngoing to rip your eyes out and\nshove them up your ass when I\nget there.\n\nCassandra looks to Liliane and gives her the 'bill please' symbol with her index and thumb. Liliane nods and completes the sale. Cassandra signs while on the phone.\n\nDante is standing in the mirror, flushed with excitement. She has never worn clothes this expensive before.\n\nLiliane comes around the counter to show them out. Dante puts on her new, FAUX FUR-COLLARED TRENCH COAT. Liliane unlocks the door and opens it.\n\nLILIANE\nIt was lovely to meet you,\nDante. Any friend of Ms.\nConstantine is a friend of\nours. Please come see us for\nanything you need.\n\nLiliane shakes Dante's hand with both her hands. She has pressed her personal business card into Dante's hand. Dante takes a quick look at the card and smiles.\n\nCassandra reaches out and closes Dante's hand again. She gives her a look as though to say, don't be tacky.\n\nCassandra suddenly looks a bit flushed and seems to have become a bit flustered. She almost looks soft. As though she notices, her face suddenly hardens again, she releases Dante's hand and quickens the exit.\n\nCASSANDRA\nThank you, Liliane. You are a\ngem. Now, I have an\nappointment with a client,\nso I must be off.\n\nCassandra turns around and leaves.\n\nDANTE\nThank you, Ms. Liliane. I\nreally appreciate your help.\n\nLILIANE\nThey will be delivered to\nyour office today. Would you\n\nLIKE YOUR ORIGINAL CLOTHING\ndelivered as well?\n\nDante takes a moment to consider.\n\nDANTE\nNo, thank you Liliane. You can\nburn those.\n\nLiliane smiles graciously and lets her out the front door. As Dante leaves, we see her look back. Liliane is still standing at the door smiling and nodding in goodbye. Dante smiles warmly back.\n\n\nEXT. SAK'S FIFTH AVE - LATE MORNING - CONTINUOUS\n\nDante turns and we see that she is surrounded by a sea\nof swarming taxis. The streets are steamy as the sun\nis now beaming brightly down on this glorious winter\nday in NYC. Dante takes a deep breath and smiles.\nAs she scans the bustling city scene for Cassandra, we\nsee her getting into a cab. Dante walks towards her,\nsomewhat unsteady in her new heels.\n\nCassandra sees her and lowers her window. She has her\nphone in her hand that she uses emphatically.\n\nCASSANDRA\nOne more thing Dante... don't\nyou dare puke tonight. I've spent\na lot of fucking money on you.\n(beat)\n\nYOU LOOK GOOD.\n(beat; intense)\nOh, and Dante... don't ask,\n\nDON'T TELL.\n(beat)\nYou should get back to work.\n\nCassandra tells the cab driver where to go while\nsimultaneously answering her ringing phone and putting\nthe window up. The cab takes off before Dante can\nrespond.\n\nCassandra's cab whizzes off leaving Dante\nstranded, confused, yet strangely empowered.\nAfter a beat, she starts to hail a cab.\n\n\nEXT. TWIN TOWERS\nDante gets out of the cab and looks up at the towers.\nShe takes a deep breath and smiles before walking in.\n\n\nINT. BEL INC. OFFICE - 11:30AM\n\nDING! The elevator doors open and we see Dante struggling\nto walk in her new HIGH HEELS.\n\nDante looks around. She has never seen anything like\nit in her life. There are well over 30 brokers\nspeaking on their phones simultaneously. Some are\nshouting at computer screens, some at TV screens,\nsome at each other.\n\nThey are wading in a sea of white, crumpled, tiny\nPAPER droppings.\n\nShe appears frozen in her tracks, as she has no idea\nwhat to do or where to go.\n\nGreta sees her coming and goes straight to her.\n\nGRETA\nAh! You look absolutely stunning. It is so wonderful to\nhave another female around here, and a beautiful one at\nthat.\n\nDANTE\nThank you, Greta. I hope I\nwasn't gone too long. I\ncouldn't seem to hail a\ncab...\n\nGRETA\nI wouldn't worry about that.\nYou still don't know how\nthings work around here.\n\nGreta gives Dante a little wink.\n\nGRETA (CONT'D)\nWell, shall we continue our\ntour? Show off this beautiful\noutfit!\n\nDANTE\nYes... I, uh, did a little\nshopping...\n\nGRETA\nWise choice, love. Well, we\nmight as well start with my\noffice.\n\nGreta starts to walk down the hall, beckoning Dante to\njoin her.\n\nThey head up the stairs to the 3rd level towards a\ndesk facing the pit.\n\n\nINT. BEL INC. - GRETA'S DESK - MORNING\n\nGreta's desk is beautiful. Her area is decorated in\nmostly yellow. It is very cozy and somehow feels like\na country home. As soon as Dante enters, Greta,\nseemingly psychic, has already poured her a giant\nGLASS of water and hands her a TYLENOL. She picks up\na box of BAND-AIDS and removes two.\n\nGRETA\nSelf-care is key. Always take\ncare of yourself first.\n\nGreta looks at her intently. Dante nods and downs the\nwater and pill, while Greta kneels and puts the band-\naids on the backs of her ankles.\n\nDANTE\n(looking down at Greta)\nI think I'm starting to\n\nUNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE CALLS\nyou 'Greatness'.\n\nGreta looks up at her with a large smile.\n\nGRETA\nLet's leave that coat in my\noffice for now.\n\nDante hands her the coat and Greta hangs it on a hook.\n\n\nINT. BEL INC. CORRIDOR - RIGHT OF THE PIT (CONTINUOUS)\n\nAs they leave her office, we see that Greta is proud\nof her position, and it shows. She is aware of\neveryone around her and what they are doing -- even\nif she doesn't acknowledge it.\n\nGRETA\n(pointing at the desk they just left)\nI am usually on the top level, but if you don't see me there, don't worry. Leave me a note and I will get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nAs they head back down the stairs, Dante and Greta see the SHOE REPAIR GUY, (small, 50-something, nervous looking Italian man), frantically buffing Abe's shoes. No one knows his actual name, nor do they seem to care. Abe is reading the NEWSPAPER and doesn't look up.\n\nABE\nMake sure you have new laces for me tomorrow.\n\nSHOE REPAIR GUY\nYou got 'er Mr. Hinkley.\n\nGreta gestures towards the Shoe Repair Guy and Abe.\n\nGRETA\nYou should know that Joaquin insists that everyone has their shoes buffed on Thursdays. In fact, it is company policy. You will see that in 'the book' you receive tomorrow.\n\nDante smiles. She has never, in her entire life, had anything polished for her.\n\nAbe peers over his newspaper and looks Dante up and down. Dante becomes so flustered that she trips towards Greta. Greta catches her. Abe looks down at his newspaper.\n\nGRETA (CONT'D)\nOopsies! I've got you Dante. It looks like you may need a little more help walking for a bit.\n\nGreta smiles and takes her arm. Dante is flushed with embarrassment as she looks back to Abe. Only, Abe seems to be gone, and we see XANDER, (handsome, shy, 30-something man), just sitting down in his spot.\n\nXANDER\nJust what's necessary, please.\n\nSHOE REPAIR GUY\nYou got it, Mr. Lavery.\n\nAs the shoe repair guy shakes his head and gets to work, Xander looks up at Dante 'walking'. Greta is moving her along.\n\nGreta is pointing to an elevator. She is speaking loudly as they are right in front of the pit where brokers are shouting at their various technologies. Each of them is outfitted with a beeper, and each manager is outfitted with a pager and a beeper. We hear these beeping and vibrating randomly constantly.\n\nGRETA\nAs you are allowed 5-minute smoke breaks, you can take that elevator down to 'P' to the smoking cage.\nThe cafeteria is on the 30th floor, the mall is on the train level.\n(she points to an elevator across from them on the floor below)\nNever use this one. This one is for executives only.\n\nGreta gives her a gentle but knowing smile.\n\nDANTE\nUmmm...I don't smoke?\n\nGRETA\nYou will.\n\nThey move past the elevator and Greta points to a spot above the pit. It is all mirrored windows, including the door.\n\nGRETA\nThat is Joaquin's office. You may not be able to see in, but rest assured, if he's in his office, he is always watching. It's best not to disturb him...\n(beat)\n... ever.\n\nGreta smiles again and takes her towards the pit. She points to the back offices behind it.\n\nGRETA\nIn those back offices are Tina and Benny. They receive your tickets and take care of it from there.\n\nCROOKED TITS (mousy woman in her 40s), looks up from her desk. Her eyes squint at Dante. She looks unimpressed, purses her lips and looks back down.\n\nBenny, (late 30s, handsome and unassuming), looks up and smiles.\n\nDante is clinging to Greta's arm for support. Some brokers are starting to turn and are laughing amongst each other. Greta and Dante stop in front of the pit.\n\nGRETA\n(claps her hands)\nEveryone! Listen up!\n\nWe see and hear the muffled sounds of about 30 brokers putting their clients on hold. We see Laynah on the phone with her back to Dante and Greta. She turns around, looks Dante up and down, then turns to resume her phone call. All other eyes are on Dante.\n\nGRETA\nThis is Dante. This is her first day...\n\nWe see that the brokers are a bit confused and looking at each other.\n\nGRETA\n(teasingly)\n... so, you bad boys be good to her. She is a very, very sweet girl and needs a hearty welcome from all of you.\n(she gives a look to a couple of the brokers)\n\nDante nervously looks around. All is quiet except the muffled voice of Laynah in the background.\n\nThe crowd erupts. It is like a Circus of Idiots. Each idiot encouraging the next with some whistling at Dante. One broker starts imitating Dante's walk crudely.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\nDon't worry Dante, I love the handicapped!\n\nAnother is bobbing his head up and down between another broker's legs. He is giving him an air blowie.\n\nBROKER\nThis is how we show our love around here, Dante!\n\nWe hear the broker receiving the blowie having a giant orgasm and pounding his chest.\n\nMIKE CHRISTIAN\nYes. YES. YESSSSS!!!! I LOVE YOU DANTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAnother broker is unbuttoning his dress shirt and ripping it open, massaging his chest hair and nipples roughly.\n\nBROKER\nHey Dante! I would love to see a little more of your neckline...I mean, chest line. Fuck it. Your tits!\n\nGreta is just laughing as though they are her children doing a fun skit they made for mom.\n\nGRETA\nOh, you boys.\n(to Dante)\nThey are incredibly incorrigible. But I do love them. And you'll grow to love them too.\n(she puts her hands up)\nOk, boys. Settle down.\n\nDante waits a beat deciding if she should respond to the crowd or not.\n\nDANTE\nHello everyone. I look forward to working with all of you. I'm... I'm ready to learn everything I can.\n\nThe room is quiet save for a few brokers piping up to say immature shit like, \"shower! shower!\", \"$100 to you if it sticks!\" while a broker is holding up a quarter or flicking their tongues between their 'v' fingers at their mouth.\n\nWe are unsure if she is going to speak again. Slowly, she takes off her heels. There's a moment where they wonder if she's going to strip. For once, it quiets everyone.\n\nLaynah peers over.\n\nDANTE\nAnd... you should know that I may not know how to use these for walking ...\n(holds up a HIGH HEEL)\nbut, I certainly know how to use them as a weapon.\n\nWithout skipping a beat, Dante swiftly whips it like a throwing star towards the cork board at the opposite wall, hitting a paper perfectly in the center. We see that it is a defaced PICTURE OF CLINTON. The crowd is quiet and then erupts into voracious laughter, whooping and clapping before resuming their phone calls.\n\nGreta turns to Dante and winks.\n\nGRETA\nWell played. I think that you will fit in here just fine.\n\nGreta starts walking her to her new desk. Dante is walking steady and confident in her bare feet, one heel in hand. The men are all back on their calls and a couple even turn to Dante with approving nods.\n\nThe defaced picture of Clinton falls unceremoniously to the ground.\n\n\nINT. 2ND LEVEL TRADING PIT - DANTE'S DESK\n\nThey reach Dante's desk - it is curved, institutional,\nand battle-scarred. Laminate top chipped at the edges,\nscratched from years of frantic notetaking. Built like a\ntank to withstand the daily assault of Wall Street\nintensity.\n\nWe see YURI, (40-something man with salt-and-pepper hair),\nat the desk beside, face down, and one pant leg wet on\nthe inside.\n\nGRETA\nI'll be right back. This will\nbe your desk. So, please make\nyourself comfortable.\n\nGreta swiftly exits and Dante takes a moment to look\naround and take in her surroundings. The people, the\noffice, the din, the chaos. She smiles and places her\nnew purse on her desk.\n\nMike the Shit looks up from the desk on the floor\nimmediately below and pipes up.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\n(into phone)\nHoly shit! Everyone is on the\nphone right now buying Cisco\nup! Let me call my supervisor\n\nOVER TO\npre-approve you for more shares...\n\nMike hits the hold button and puts the phone to his chest.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT (CONT'D)\nHey Laynah, I thought Abe\ntold you to leave your dirty\nman whores at home? This one\npissed himself!\n\nLaynah, mid-phone dial, peeks out from the other side\nof Mike's desk.\n\nLAYNAH\nThis one is a welcome present\nfor our 'new broker'.\n\nWe see Greta rushing back like a Geisha to her top\nclient. She has a fresh pair of SLACKS in one hand\nand a GLASS OF WATER in another. She is back in an\nabnormally fast time.\n\nLAYNAH (CONT'D)\n(to Dante)\nYou may wanna have Greta take\nthis one to the cleaners\nfirst.\n\nFor the first time, Dante sees a slightly unimpressed\nlook on Greta's face as she ignores Laynah's comment.\nMike and Laynah are back on their phones.\n\nGreta picks up his head, shoves a strange colored pill\nin his mouth and force feeds him the water. She has her\nback to Dante to try and create some privacy with the\nscene.\n\nGRETA\nCome now Yuri. Let's get you\ncleaned up.\n\nGreta helps him up while he mumbles what sounds\nlike Russian and starts grabbing at her breasts.\n\nYURI\n(in Russian)\nBoobies...\n\nGreta turns her head back to Dante for a moment.\n\nGRETA\nTennie will get you set up. I\nhope you can excuse me.\n\nDANTE\nOf course.\n\nDante turns back to her desk to see Tennessee. He is\nalready into her computer typing madly. Things seem to\nmove incredibly fast around here. He doesn't acknowledge\nher.\n\nShe looks down at Mike the Shit, who is leaned back in\nhis chair on the phone, looking at her. He turns back\ntowards his computer, talking to his client.\n\nIn the background, she sees Abe standing by a post. He\nhas one hand in a slight fist, elegantly placed just\nin front of his chest, and the other arm behind him.\nThe calmness that he exudes is in stark contrast to\nthe frenzy of the crowd.\n\nHe has been watching her, but we have no idea for how\nlong. He lifts a finger and beckons her over.\n\nDANTE\nExcuse me, Tennessee.\n\nTENNESSEE\nTennie. Only my mom calls me\nby my full name.\n\nTennie doesn't look up from the computer screen. Other\nthan what he said, he seems barely aware of anyone's\npresence.\n\nShe heads over immediately.\n\nABE\nI'm taking you to lunch Dante.\n\nSeemingly more like a command than a request, Dante\nquickly eyes the clock. It is almost 1pm. Abe's gaze\nis steady and unreadable.\n\nDANTE\nYes, of course, Abe. Let me\ngrab my purse.\n\nABE\nThat won't be necessary.\n\nHe smiles for the first time at her. A smile that is\nimpossible to read. From behind his back, he produces\nher 'throwing star' missing heel as well as her coat\nthat she left at the bar. Dante sheepishly takes her\nitems back.\n\nDANTE\n(laughing nervously)\nNo shirt, no shoes, no service?\n\nHe turns and glides like an electric eel through the\nbrokers. Dante quickly follows behind like a lost\nduckling, high heels in hand. Without looking behind\nhim:\n\nABE\nAnd put your god damn shoes on.\n\nDante scrambles to put her heels on only to re-commence\nher awkward walk. She hears snickering behind her.\n\nThey head to the broker elevator this time rather than\nthe Michaelangelean executive elevator she took with\nCassandra.\n\nDante slips in and stands beside Abe just as the door\nis about to close. He is stoic and refined. She is\nflustered and sweaty.\n\nDING! The doors close.\n\nEND OF ACT TWO\n\nACT THREE\n\n\nINT. GEMINI'S BAR - 1PM\n\nEmma is smiling. The scene mirrors exactly what we saw\na few hours prior with Dante and Cassandra - same\nseats, different meeting. There is a 'Groundhog's Day'\nfeel for a beat. Abe's pager and beeper are on the bar\nbetween them, and he checks them periodically when\nDante is speaking.\n\nABE\nWould you like an orange juice?\n(he eyes his watch)\nIt's still morning.\n\nDante feels immediately sick. Abe nods to the\nbartender as she goes off to makes the drinks.\n\nDANTE\nI... I would love one.\nI always start the day with a\njuice. You know, a kick of\nvitamin C to keep my immune\nsystem strong --\n\nABE\n-- How is your first day going so far?\n(looks her up and down)\nI see that you are very\n\nCOMFORTABLE WITH YOUR NEW\nposition.\n\nEmma arrives just in time with what looks like the\nexact same drinks as earlier. Dante, grateful this\ntime, shoots it back. Abe takes a small and graceful\nsip.\n\nABE\nDante. Take it easy. It's\nstill early.\n\nDANTE\nSorry. I guess I was thirsty.\nUh, maybe I'll just get a\ntea?\n\nABE\nNo. You'll get another juice,\nbut you'll pace yourself.\n\nDANTE\nYes, sir.\n\nABE\n-- Sir? What happened to the\ngirl earlier this morning who\nwas spouting off about money,\npower, and prestige?\n(he laughs)\nYou didn't even have shoes on\n10 minutes ago.\n\nAbe smiles at her.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nGo ahead and order another.\n\nDante tries to catch Emma's eye and starts tapping the\nbar with two fingers. Tap tap. Tap TAP. Abe appears\nto be scrutinizing her methods, adding to her\nnervousness.\n\nTAP TAP TAP TAP!\n\nEmma is at the other end chatting up another customer.\nDante puts her fingers in her mouth and whistles. Abe\ngrabs her hand out of her mouth and pulls it down to\nthe bar, holding it tightly. Emma shoots her a glare.\n\nABE\nThat, you shall never do again.\n\nDANTE\nRight. Sorry.\n\nWhilst still holding Dante's hand and gaze, he\nelegantly taps his fingers on the bar twice. If you\nsaw only this moment in time, you would think that\nAbe is training a monkey. Emma starts preparing their\ndrinks. Dante looks mortified.\n\nABE\n(still gripping her hand)\nLet's hear your story.\n\nDante hiccups and covers her mouth, mortified.\n\nDANTE\n(embarrassed)\nWell, breakfast booze is new to me.\n\nDante shifts in her seat, trying to find a nonchalant\nway to get her hand back.\n\nABE\nLet's hear the parts of your\n\nSTORY THAT AREN'T GLARINGLY\n\nOBVIOUS.\n(beat)\nWait. Let me guess.\n\nAbe is looking at her studiously.\n\nThe drinks arrive and Abe doesn't break his gaze.\nDante looks to Emma apologetically. Emma glowers and\nwalks away.\n\nHe continues to study her up and down slowly. Taking\nhis time at each body part. Dante instinctively closes\nher body inwards. Abe reaches forward and slowly\nunwinds her.\n\nHe takes all of her in before leaning forward. In\nvampirish fashion, he inhales her decolletage deeply\nand slowly. There is an extended beat as we see his\nmouth slowly open by her neck.\n\nABE\n\n... PINE-SOL SOAP...\n(inhales again)\n\nAHHH...THERE IS A PERFUME...\nyes... Lysol. Dumpy-ass motel scent.\n\nHe tightens his grip on her hand. She winces.\n\nAm I right?\n(beat)\n\nWAIT...\n(fondling a tag left on\n\nHER SUIT JACKET)\n\nMMMMMM...\nyes --\n\nAbe sits back and finally releases the tight grip on\nher hand.\n\nABE\n-- Cassandra popped your Saks\ncherry.\n\nDante immediately pulls her hand in and\ninstinctively massages it.\n\nDante is looking back at him blankly.\n\nAbe breaks into a somewhat demented and creepy laughter.\n\nHe slaps Dante on the back.\n\nABE\n(off her reaction)\nI'm just trying to get a rise\n\nOUT OF YOU.\n(beat)\nSeriously. I would like to\nhear your story.\n\nDante is clearly in way over her head and is trying to\nstay in control. Abe taps the bar for 2 more juices.\n\nDANTE\nAh, two more juices.\nExcellent.\n\nWhile she is speaking, Abe is pulling out a giant\nWAD OF MONEY in a gold MONEY CLIP. Each bill seems\nto be a $100 bill, and there appear to be about 1.5\ninches of them. Emma places a fresh juice in front\nof each of them.\n\nAbe unfurls his wad and passes Emma a few of the bills.\n\nABE\n(over)-- Let's keep 'em\ncoming for the rest of the\nday Emma.\n\nAbe takes another quick look at Dante.\n\nABE\n(off Dante)\nLet's make that day, and\nnight. BEL-Style.\n\nHe flicks another couple hundreds at her. It doesn't\nseem to diminish the wad thickness at all. Emma smiles\nprofessionally and heads off to make another round.\nEmma doesn't seem fazed by the amount of money just\nthrown at her.\n\nABE\nGo on...\n\n\nINT. GEMINI'S BAR VIP ROOM - LATER\n\nDante and Abe are deep in conversation in a private VIP room booth. Abe's scotch glass is half-empty and Dante's scotch glass is full. Dante is visibly drunk, and she is eating the last of the pretzels in a bowl right in front of her.\n\nDANTE\n--that's why I work as hard as I do. Let's just say I learned early that no one was gonna hand me anything. I will never go back...\n\nEXCUSE ME --\n(crying)\n-- Sorry, I don't usually...\n\nAbe passes her a napkin off the table. She dabs below her eyes, somewhat missing part of the make-up in her state.\n\nDANTE\nShit. I hate talking about my family.\n(studying him intensely)\nI never talk about this stuff.\n\nDante looks to Abe as he nods politely. He seems like a different person than before - soft, kind, heartfelt even.\n\nDante dabs below her eyes again and blows her nose with the napkin. She takes a deep breath and collects herself.\n\nDANTE\nCan I tell you something Abe?\n\nABE\nSure thing.\n\nDante leans in.\n\nDANTE\nI have never worn heels in my entire life.\n(beat)\nShhhhhhhh...\n\nAbe takes a moment to look at her incredulously.\n\nABE\n\nOH. OH.\n(patting himself down)\nGive me a moment here to find my surprise face.\n\nThey have a laugh together and we see Dante clearly relieved at the lightness she has found with Abe. We see the bartender bringing over new DRINKS plus 2 SHOTS. She sets them on the table and cleans the empties off.\n\nDANTE\nUgh. I'm sick of talking about my life.\n(studying Abe's face)\nHow did you really know about my past?\n\nAbe takes a moment to consider his response. He takes a large sip of his drink and downs his shot. Dante downs her shot as well.\n\nABE\nI have a knack. I can read people. I used to think everybody could do it.\n\nDANTE\nYah. No.\n\nABE\nI learned that during my first fist fight in grade 7. I was small for my age, so when I entered junior high, the taller boys started to pick on me.\n(beat)\nThere was one gang, The Bloodgang, not very original I know, that was... particularly intimidating. One day, the leader, Civatrelli, and his 4 thug friends gathered around me in a circle. To further the clich\u00e9, they wanted my lunch money. Civatrelli was punching my shoulder to weaken my will.\n(beat)\nI don't know how else to explain this, but suddenly, all I saw was... truth. It was almost as though I could see a life map inside of him.\n(beat)\nI went on to tell him about\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nhis whore mother, who cheated on his father, with his best friend. And, when he was left home alone with his uncle, while his mom was off whoring, his uncle was diddling him in his bed.\n(beat)\nThe shock on their faces was my first indication that there was something unique about what I could see. I don't know if I just read people well or if it is some extra-sensory gift.\n\nDANTE\nSo, what happened?\n\nABE\nOh... I had the living SHIT beat out of me. And they took my lunch money.\n\nHe laughs, with Dante following suit.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nBut they never came near me again.\nI admired their power and audacity. How they just took whatever they wanted. I studied them for the rest of the year, spying on their bullying. Eventually, I became a part of their group... their secret weapon, if you will.\n\nDANTE\nSo, this is your secret to your success?\n\nABE\nI would say that is part of it, yes. I learned a lot about the power of knowing the truth that day. And learning how to get what you want.\n\nAs Dante takes this in, she looks around the bar. It is starting to fill. Her eyes settle on a 30-something, incredibly handsome male at the end of the bar. Abe turns to study him intensely.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nMmm. Wanna-be. Bullshit bar stool philosopher. I'd say a... substitute teacher. Hoping to be noticed by a higher up in our business to make the amount of money he tells the ladies he makes.\n(beat)\nPlayer. Has had an ugly girlfriend since high school who pays for his life. She thinks he is volunteering at the high school right now.\n\nDante looks around and settles on a very well-dressed woman sitting at a booth with an older gentleman.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nAh yes. My guess would be a high-end escort. Daddy ran off with a younger woman when she was just a child. Mother raised her and her 5 siblings alone on a cashier's wage. She got into the biz to help her family.\n\nDante looks impressed.\n\nDANTE\nYou are a fascinating man.\n(beat)\nThank you so much for hiring me. It's truly such an honour to be --\n\nABE\n-- you don't actually think you are hired do you?\n\nDante is laughing while Abe's face darkens.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nWe don't just take any Spic with a rack off the street and make them richer than a Colombian fucking drug lord!\n(laughs)\nThere is a process, Dante.\n(beat)\nSo here is the way it works. If you make it through the night --and please take this all in at once, because I hate repeating myself-- I expect you to get to work early. If you are late, you may get cut. Period.\nAlso, if you have any complaints, keep them to yourself. Usually, we are too busy to give a fuck, and if it is important enough, you will remember it when we aren't busy.\n(beat)\nWhich never happens. My suggestion is to run it past Greta. She has been around long enough to let you know if you are complaining about something petty, or if you have a verifiable issue.\nNext, be yourself. Don't try to be like anyone else in this firm. If I wanted a fucking clone, I would've gone to the Roslin Institute. But, if you do want to emulate someone, then continue to follow Cassandra. That woman knows how to make money.\n(beat)\nOh, and never ask me a question twice. If I don't answer it the first time, it's because I have no intention of answering.\n\nHe sits back in his chair slowly and takes a deep breath. He tips back the rest of his scotch. His hand goes up to the approaching bartender in a 'stop' gesture.\n\nAfter an uncomfortably long beat:\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nYou need two giant balls to work here, Dante. Do you have two giant balls?\n\nDante is speechless and cannot get a beat on him.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nDO YOU? DO YOU HAVE TWO GIANT BALLS?\n\nDANTE\nYes. Yes, I do.\n\nAbe takes a moment to look at her.\n\nABE\nNo. No you don't. You're a woman. You have a little flower vagina. I have two giant balls. Two giant balls made of pure gold.\n\nAbe is grabbing his testicles firmly.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nDo you want to see them?\n\nAbe is shaking his testicles up and down. He drops them and leans forward.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nAnd let me tell you something. That SHIT you pulled during your interview this morning...\n(intensifying)\nin your CHEAP HOOKER outfit...\n\nAbe is now poking her shoulder, harder and harder. Dante grabs the side of the table to steady herself. His eyes are blazing and intense as lasers.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\n... is never, EVER going to happen again. Do you hear me?\n(shouting)\nI AM RICH. I AM POWERFUL. AND NO ONE, AND I MEAN NO ONE, FUCKS WITH ME.\n\nDante is frozen in terror. Abe is sweating. He sits back and calms himself. He takes a small POCKET SQUARE from his suit pocket and serenely wipes his upper lip. We see some brokers quickly glance over.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nThe only reason you are sitting here today is because of the power of Cassandra's pussy. That pussy's got fangs.\n\nAbe takes a large breath.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nNow, I am going to tell you something that is going to stay between you and me.\n\nAbe leans in. Dante can barely find her voice. Dante leans in cautiously.\n\nDANTE\nOf course.\n\nABE\nThis is very serious Dante.\n\nAbe leans in further and lowers his voice.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nOne of the men, here tonight...\n(beat)\n... has... one nut.\n\nDANTE\nSorry?\n\nAbe appears exasperated.\n\nABE\nNut, Dante. NUT.\nBall. Fuck orb. Ass slapper. Tea bag. TESTICLE.\n\nAbe sits back smugly and smiles. He is quite visibly drunk.\n\nDANTE\nOne... nut. Okay. One nut. Alright.\n\nThe doors fly open to the private room and in walk a steady stream BROKERS. CIGARETTES hanging out of their mouths. We see them smirking at Dante and heading to an adjacent booth. She looks at the front of everyone's pants and quickly looks away.\n\nAbe leans forward.\n\nABE\n(quietly)\nHere are the rules: You have the rest of tonight to find out who our nutless Joe is. Without divulging our secret, of course. If you are correct in identifying this ball-less wonder, you can start your training. If you are incorrect, Dante, it's back to your ship-wrecked whore momma to scrub toilets on the Upper East Side. Or any of the other fuck shit welfare slave jobs from your Dominican sob story.\n(beat)\nYou can let me know who it is. 7am tomorrow morning.\n(looks at his phone, lights blinking with messages waiting)\nNow, I've wasted enough time here and have a lot of work to get back to. I leave you with the Band of Idiots.\n\nWith that, Abe stands up to make an announcement.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nWELL. EVERYONE!\n\nThe motley mob miraculously quiets and looks up towards him. He is truly commandeering.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nIT'S BEEN A SLICE, BUT IT IS TIME FOR THIS OLE PENCIL-NECKED PRICK TO LEAVE.\n\nAbe ends his announcement looking at Dante and smiling. Abe wags his finger at Dante for all to see.\n\nHe suddenly seems stone sober.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\nRemember what I told you Dante -- unless you want to join madre...\n\nHe puts his fingers up to his lips.\n\nABE (CONT'D)\n\n...SHHHHHHHHHH.\n(beat)\nHave at 'er boys. This one was nursed on Coors Light, so no need to break the bank.\n\nAbe leaves through the VIP room doors.\n\nFlickers through the swinging doors reveal Abe with the 'teacher' and 'high end hooker' from his psychic reading hours earlier. They're greeting him like old friends. Dante's laugh is bitter - she realizes she's been conned.\n\nDANTE\n(to the brokers)\nI need... I need to use the washroom. Excuse me.\n\n\nINT. GEMINIS WASHROOM\n\nDante stares at her blurry reflection in the mirror. A\nsilent pep talk seems to be taking place as she glances\ntoward the door - weighing her escape. She looks back at\nthe mirror, studying her drunken reflection for a few\nbeats. Stay or go?\n\nHer expression shifts - from uncertainty to something\ndeeper. Whatever she's thinking about, it's bigger than\nthis moment. Her jaw sets with quiet determination. Two\nyears. She only needs two years.\n\nShe takes her pulse at her wrist - elevated. Pulls down\nher lower lip in the mirror, checking circulation.\n\nKnowing she has a narrow window before full absorption,\nshe kneels by the toilet and forces herself to vomit.\n\n48.\n\nBack at the sink, she turns on the tap and drinks heavily\nfrom her cupped hands, rehydrating. She pulls a granola\nbar from her purse and devours it to slow any remaining\nalcohol absorption.\n\nShe takes a deep breath, straightens her shoulders, and\nheads back out.\n\n\nINT. PRIVATE VIP ROOM - GIANT BOOTH - 5PM\n\nDante is sandwiched in the middle of a semi-circle in the booth between Dunaway (sweet, shy, geeky broker in his 20s) Mike the Shit, Mike Christian (tall, sweet, even-tempered broker in his 30s) and Yuri (who looks as though he has seen better days). In the center of the table are ICE BINS chilling 3 BOTTLES OF VEUVE.\n\nThere are many, many SHOOTERS on the table, all still full. In fact, every inch is filled. In this sea of shooters, we see 4 FLUTE GLASSES.\n\nDunaway reaches over and grabs a Veuve.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\nCan we pop this for you?\n\nThe boys snicker.\n\nDANTE\nI'd like to see you try.\n\nThe group gives a bit of an 'ooooooohhhh, ahhhhhhh' and laughs.\n\nDunaway tries to pop the cork. He cannot seem to get it.\n\nMIKE CHRISTIAN\nSeriously? Pass that over.\n\nHe grabs the bottle from Dunaway and tries with even greater fervor. He cannot get it.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\nPUSSIES! Yuri would have a better chance of opening it than you two faggots.\n\nWe see a quick shot of Yuri again. He is quiet and wan. Barely present.\n\nMike the Shit snatches the bottle away and goes at it with great difficulty.\n\nKENSINGTON, (gorgeous 30-something Amazonian bartender) is dressed in a sports HALTER TOP and tight SKIRT. She is part owner of this bar, and it shows in her actions. She is watching all of this and walks over, GIANT SABRE in hand that she has just taken from her BELT.\n\nShe grabs the bottle and sabers it. Perfectly. She pours up the flutes and keeps walking.\n\nEveryone laughs except Mike the Shit.\n\nMike the Shit picks up his flute glass. The rest of the guys follow suit. We see Dunaway placing a flute in Yuri's hand. He shakily lifts his flute glass to join the others.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\n\nWELCOME TO THE FIRM...\n(reconsiders a beat)\nWhoa. Whoa. Wait.\n\nMike the Shit takes a long look at Dante.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\nI'm not going to cheers with her until she tells us what Abe said.\n(he intensifies his stare)\nWhat was that secret all about? Hey, Dante?\n\nDante freezes for a moment.\n\nMIKE CHRISTIAN\nYah, good point Mike.\n(turns to Dante)\nNo secrets in this firm. Not wise to get off to a bad start with us. We're your allies.\n(beat)\nManagement will just use you to get what they want. We are the ones who support each other. And since Abe isn't exactly an open book, we need to know any grain of information that he may divulge. Now, 'fess up.\n\nThey are all nodding. Yuri nods with a delay.\n\nDante sits back and nonchalantly looks at Mike Christian's crotch beside her. We see a bit of a bulge, but it is hard to tell in suit pants. She is feigning that she is thinking and rubbing the back of her neck.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\nWere you just staring at Mike's crotch?\n\nMIKE CHRISTIAN\nNo secrets between us, right?\n(beat)\n9 inches.\n\nThey all burst out laughing. Dante immediately tries to change the subject.\n\nDANTE\nSooo, how long you guys been at the firm?\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\nDon't try and change the subject. How about we play a little drinking game, winner gets the secret? A little, 'who here owns... ?' game?\n\nNods all around. Everyone reaches for a shot.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\nWho here owns a Porsche?\n\nNo one drinks.\n\nDUNAWAY\nIf you don't, you have to drink.\n\nDANTE\nOk, wait, wait. This isn't fair. I just started here...\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\nIt's the rules. We all play by the rules. Don't we guys?\n\nThey are all nodding. Dante tips back her shot.\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\nNext question. Who here owns a mansion in The Hamptons.\n(to Dante)\nDo you? Drink up.\n\nThe guys are laughing and drinking their champagne. As Dante reaches for a shot -\n\n\nINT. PRIVATE VIP ROOM - DOORWAY\n\nBAM! The deep brown leather, brass-trimmed, saloon-style doors to the room fly open. Joaquin enters quickly, 1 GIANT MOTOROLA CELL PHONE in each hand, one to his ear, one on his chest. He has a cigar hanging out of his mouth, plumes of smoke billowing upwards.\n\nJOAQUIN\n(into phone, very loud)\n...you want what? Hold on... I'm on an important call.\n\nHe puts that phone to his chest and takes the other one to his ear.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\n(into phone)\nOk. 3 pairs of Valentino custom made. Have 'em here by next week. And don't you dare send me that ass hide you tried selling me last week. Alright... bye-bye.\n\nHe hangs that phone up and takes the one on his chest up to his ear.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\nTamara... honey. What's wrong with your Maserati? Don't you have homework? Go make yourself a stiff drink until the craving passes.\n\nHe hangs up and loudly bangs both phones on the bar like setting his rifles down at the end of the day.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\nChewie!\n\nWe can see that Kensington loves his humor and equally loves to sass him back.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\n(pointing to the TVs above the bar playing the news)\nTurn that shit up!\n\nKENSINGTON\n(while grabbing the remote)\nFuck you, Joaquin.\n\nJoaquin looks towards the booth, impressed that she just said 'fuck you' to him.\n\nWe see the brokers in the booth laughing.\n\nHe extends his arms to their furthest length on the bar wood while still looking at the booth.\n\nJOAQUIN\nI want this many shots! Make them from the House of Cognac..\n\nJoaquin is still looking at the booth, especially Dante, eyes twinkling.\n\nKensington starts setting up SHOT GLASSES between his hands. His hands don't move.\n\nEveryone at the booth leans back, laughing.\n\nDUNAWAY\nHerrrrrre comes The Joaquin Show. Brace yourself Dante.\n\nThe group is laughing and nodding as they all nurse a shot.\n\nJOAQUIN\nHey... HEY! Make 'em tight as your arse, Blanche.\n\nDante watches as Kensington fills every square inch of space between his outstretched arms with shooters. We also notice that she is pouring from the LOUIS XIII CRYSTAL BOTTLE, $10,000/bottle.\n\nMike Christian nods his head towards Mike the Shit.\n\nMIKE CHRISTIAN\nJust be happy Mike's not ordering the shots.\n\nMike the Shit gives him a long-armed punch from across the table. To Dante:\n\nMIKE CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)\nSee what I mean?\n\nJoaquin lumbers over with 2 shots in each hand, fingers in the shot glasses and giant phones under his armpits. The humor in his walk is only exacerbated by the bulky pager and beeper hanging off his belt loops.\n\nIn the b.g. Kensington is loading the rest of the shots; a double-decker tray.\n\nJOAQUIN\nHoly shit, what a motley crew! Make some room for some high quality.\n\nHe seems to be referring to himself and his shooters as he pushes his way into the sardine booth, facing the TVs. He passes Dante the two shots in his right hand. While licking the booze off his fat finger and thumb:\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\n(to Dante)\nOHHHHHHH STATE! You look a fright!\n(looks at her again)\nSo, how's it goin', Fancypants?\n\nHe looks over at Yuri, who has been quiet up to this point. Joaquin flamboyantly jumps back in feigned fright.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\nJesus! You got a face on you like a bag 'o smashed assholes! What's the matter YURINE, wet undies givin' you a rash?\n\nYuri smiles with a delay and gives a thumbs up.\n\nYURI\n(in Russian)\nGood!\n\nEveryone is laughing. This man has a joke a second, not that you can understand them.\n\nJOAQUIN\nHoly shit. We better git some medicine in ya.\n\nKensington arrives and places all the shots Joaquin just bought on the adjacent two-top.\n\nKENSINGTON\nStartin' out slow, are we?\n\nJoaquin is beckoning to Kensington to bring him a couple of shots from his stash.\n\nJOAQUIN\n(pointing at Kensington and then Yuri)\nGet me one for Yee, and one for Pee.\n\nThe group snickers. Joaquin hands it to Yuri and looks to Dante and Kensington for a cheers.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\nDown the hatch.\n\nJoaquin gives a little look to the group, and they all grab a shot from the table. The group shoots them back. Yuri, with a delay, shoots his back also.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\nHoly shit, if I wanted to have tea with the queen, I woulda went to Buckingham fucking palace. Come on, miss, let's go.\n\nHe pushes her second shot towards her brashly. She has a mini dry heave when she takes the shot and the group snickers. They all join her for a second shot. Joaquin just grabs a random from the table.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\n(makes a face)\nGasoline!\n\nJoaquin is rubbing the chest hair spewing out of his opened dress shirt top, tie in his breast pocket. He seems to be studying her while continuing to rub his chest hair.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\nSo, who made you? Two mutts?\n\nDante has no idea what he is talking about, and it shows.\n\nMIKE CHRISTIAN\nHe means, who are your parents?\n\nJoaquin loves when someone understands what he is saying. With a wink and a head jerk, to Mike C.:\n\nJOAQUIN\nSpot on, buddy.\n\nMIKE CHRISTIAN\nDon't worry, he doesn't always talk like this. His Newfie always comes out when he drinks... or when it's showtime.\n\nJOAQUIN\nIt's NEWFOUNDLANDER to you, my son...\n\nThe group laughs. Joaquin looks back at Dante, awaiting her response.\n\nDANTE\nMy mom is Haitian, and my dad is Puerto... wait, no... other way around... ?\n\nDante is laughing. She is too drunk to remember her parents' heritage. Joaquin is shaking his head again.\n\nJOAQUIN\nHoly shit, she's not gonna last a minute. Maybe you need a shot of PENIS-CILLIN?\n\nHe grabs his package (he likes to do this). The group is killing themselves laughing. Dante eyes seem to linger a bit too long on him grabbing his package as she attempts a quick testicle count.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\nAhhh, you like that? Well, there is a lot more where that came from.\n\nThe group is still laughing. He drops his package and looks at the group as though he didn't just do anything raunchy.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\nSo, what's the word boys?\n\nMIKE THE SHIT\nWell, Dante here has a secret that Abe told her. She won't divulge.\n\nJOAQUIN\nNo secrets here, Dante. Rule #1.\n\nLaynah walks up beside Joaquin. She has changed her shirt so that her fake boobs are bursting out the impossibly small bodice she's stretched over them. She has clearly re-done her make-up, hair, and outfit. She is smiling through her fire engine red lipstick -- which is all over her front teeth.\n\nLAYNAH\nWhat's going on, boys?\n\nAs we see Dante take a sigh of relief, Joaquin turns his head right into her cleavage.\n\nJOAQUIN\nHoly shit! Ma? Ma? Is that you, MA?\n\nHe is nose deep into her cleavage and is grabbing at her breasts, as though trying to recognize them. She slaps his hands away.\n\nLAYNAH\nScrew you, Joaquin. Move over.\n\nShe barely fits herself at the end of the booth.\n\nDante looks to her and rubs her front teeth as though to tell her there is lipstick on her teeth -- girl code, and as an olive branch. She needs someone on her side here.\n\nLaynah, as usual, doesn't understand, and pretends to rub her front teeth right back, as though mocking Dante's actions. Although, she doesn't quite touch her teeth, so they stay stained.\n\nJoaquin leans over to Dante and whispers. Well, ok, he speaks loud enough for everyone to hear.\n\nJOAQUIN\nStunned as mi arse.\n\nLaynah hits Joaquin. He laughs.\n\nCassandra walks through the saloon doors, just hanging up her phone. This seems to be a much looser Cassandra than Dante from earlier as she is, yes, dancing her way towards the bar. She is quite drunk.\n\nShe stops short of the bar and throws her arms up.\n\nCASSANDRA\nThis night's on MEEEEE! WE GOT CANE DEEDS!\n\nShe is pointing towards Yuri.\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\nThat's right my friend, we did it!\n\nYuri smiles and gives another thumbs up. It looks like he has been up for days to help close this deal. We see the guys around him congratulating him.\n\nCASSANDRA (CONT'D)\nYour best tequila all around, Kensy!\n(beat, pointing to the TVs)\nTurn that shit down, and the music UP!\n\nWe see Kensington turning down the TVs and turning up the stereo. We notice that she has turned on the TV subtitles.\n\nThe group starts clapping and whooping.\n\nJOAQUIN\n(leaning into Dante)\nDon't think we are done with you.\n\nHe puts his hand on her leg and holds it there a bit too long.\n\nAs Cassandra dances over, we see everyone reaching for a shot for cheers.\n\nThe music is loud, and the party has officially started. CLINK!\n\nINT. GEMINI'S PRIVATE VIP ROOM - LATER\n\nThere is loud club music (something like Gypsy Kings - Bamboleo) and flashes of VERY DRUNK QUICK CLIPS between black transitions. We hear some dialogue here and there. Things like, 'you wanna see the real thing?' when she is caught looking at someone's package. 'What's the secret?' 'What did Abe tell you?' 'DANTE! WHAT IS THE FUCKING SECRET?!'\n\nHere we also see Paul and SMITH who is the co-owner of the bar, and twin brother of Kensington. He is in his early 30s, handsome (almost pretty), and sweet looking. Kensington introduces him to Dante. Dunaway and Smith are laughing together.\n\nCassandra is on the bar table singing, Dante and others are dancing, shooters are being tipped back, there is lots of drinking, lots of drugs, blow off hookers, gambling at the tables, men reaching for their giant money wads, brokers making out with women, Laynah giving a blowjob to a broker in a booth, and some have their arms around each other and are singing loudly. We really see the brotherhood, men demeaning women, and the excessiveness in this scene.\n\nEveryone, including Dante, seems to be having the time of their life.\n\nWe also see scenes of Cassandra telling her to 'straighten up/hold yourself together' while snorting coke from her giant, SILVER RING.\n\nEND OF ACT THREE\n\nACT FOUR\n\n\nINT. PRIVATE VIP ROOM - LATER\n\nDante looks quite green. She is swaying and her eyes look like they are blinking independently of each other. She is sweating and her make-up is running down her face.\n\nJoaquin notices her state, grabs her, and quickly ushers her into the men's washroom.\n\n\nINT. GEMINIS - MEN'S WASHROOM\n\nAs they enter, we see PAUL, in front of the urinal,\njust zipping up his pants under his giant gut. He\nlooks from Joaquin to Dante to Joaquin's 'get the fuck\nout of here' face.\n\nHe exits very quickly without a word.\n\nSHUNNNNNNNNNNNP. Joaquin drags the GARBAGE CAN in\nfront of the door.\n\nHe reaches into his pocket and takes out a rather\nLARGE BAG of WHITE POWDER and a STRAW. He proceeds to\ncreate a line on the side of the sink with his one of\nhis BLACK VISA CREDIT CARDS (we see him choosing).\n\nJOAQUIN\nYou need to straighten up.\n(passing her the straw)\nHere.\n\nDante has never done drugs in her life. Drinking,\nyes. Drugs, no.\n\nShe is drunk. She is disinhibited. She grabs the straw\nand shakily places it at the start of the line. We hear a\nbig SNIIIIIFFFFFFFF as the white powder slowly\ndisappears.\n\nAs Dante's head comes up, we see that she has a fair\namount under her nose, and she is choking.\n\nDANTE\nIt musta went down the wrong tube--\n\nJoaquin face reflects his disdain, and he hands\nher his pocket napkin.\n\nJOAQUIN\n-- Jesus. Wipe that shit up\n\nNEWBIE BEFORE SOMEONE LICKS\nit from yer nose. This is\n\nSOME VELVETY SHIT. DON'T\nwaste it.\n\nHe takes a small, what looks like a BRASS LOCKET, out\nof his other pocket. There is a small, BRASS STRAW on\ntop. He takes a different baggie of white powder out\nof the other pocket and makes a fat line.\n\nAs his head comes up, we see his face and eyes are\nblazing red. He is a whole different, and scarier,\nperson than earlier.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\n\nENOUGH'S ENOUGH. I'M GIVING\nyou 3 choices: you either\ntell me Abe's secret, I fire\nyou... or (beat) you blow me.\nRight now, Spic.\n\nDante wildly stares at Joaquin.\n\nAfter a long beat, she walks towards him slowly,\nseductively. As she approaches, she lays her hand on\nhis giant gut. He looks at her, sweating like a pig.\nHer hand slowly trails down his King Henry VIII mound,\ntowards his groin. She undoes his zipper. Her hand\nslips in. He is smiling and his head tilts back.\n\nShe grabs his testicles hard. So much so that we see\nhis body slightly raise on the wall. He is wincing in\npain. All men watching the show should be saying,\nMama, along with him.\n\nDANTE\n(whispering into his ear)\nDo you want to keep both of\nthese, or shall I bring one\nto Abe, as bounty, and create\nmy own destiny?\n\nJoaquin is shaking his head yes, then no, then...\nwhatever he is trying to convey, it clearly means, LET\nGO. She lets go of his testicles and we see him\nslightly drop to the floor. Lower than before as he\nis hunching in pain and somewhat winded.\n\nJOAQUIN\n(breathlessly)\nBitch.\n\nDante exits the washroom.\n\n\nINT. GEMINI'S BAR - 8:45PM - CONTINUOUS\n\nDante is coming out of the bathroom, sweating.\n\nXander walks straight up beside her, sipping a CLEAR DRINK with a bobbing LIME. He says nothing to her, as they watch the drunk insanity in front of them, together.\n\nDante looks to him and sees that he is watching Dunaway tuck into a SALAD. Her eyes follow to Dunaway eating.\n\nXANDER\nYou know, ever since Dunaway had the testicular cancer, he's become a real pain in the ass health nut.\n(beat)\nHe's even doing yoga.\n\nXander hands her his drink.\n\nXANDER (CONT'D)\nHere, water. You have to balance this.\n\nDante gratefully takes the water and downs it.\n\nXANDER (CONT'D)\nHave you even eaten today?\n\nBefore she can respond, Joaquin storms out of the washroom, red faced, sweaty, and freshly coked up. He is walking a bit funny.\n\nDANTE\n(to self)\nUh-oh...\n\nJOAQUIN\n(enraged and shouting)\nI think it's time that our new little piggy takes herself alllllll the way home.\n\nJoaquin is at the bar exit pointing at Dante and motioning her towards the door. He is adjusting himself in his pants.\n\nThe crowd that is close enough to hear starts laughing and oinking, before going back to their shenanigans. Dante looks around and no one seems to be helping her except Xander, who cocks his head towards the door.\n\nXANDER\nGo.\n\nDante exits quickly.\n\n\nEXT. SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF TAXI\n\nJoaquin is behind Dante, marching her out. He immediately waves a CAB down and opens a door for her.\n\nJOAQUIN\nGet in.\n\nAs Dante heads towards the cab, we see that walking has suddenly become very difficult. He grabs her arm and roughly sits her in the cab, closes the door and walks around to the CABBIE'S window. He pulls his THICK MONEY CLIP out, full of HUNDREDS.\n\nJOAQUIN (CONT'D)\nTake this ditch pig home.\n\nThe cabbie (ARMAN) is a well-manicured, AFGHAN MALE in his 40s. Joaquin slips the cabbie $100.\n\nARMAN\n(with a Farsi accent)\nYes, sir.\n\nArman starts asking Dante where to go, we see Joaquin moving back around the cab with a strange smile slowly curling across his face.\n\nHe pats the back of the cab a couple of times to send it off.\n\nBAM! BAM!\n\n\nINT. CAB - 9PM - CONTINUOUS\n\nFade in from black. It is quiet. Only the motor of the cab is heard.\n\nWe see Dante wilting in the back, head in hands.\n\nDANTE\n(to self)\nFuck. Fuck. Fucka. Fucka. Fucka. Fuck.\n\nDante slumps against the cab window, eyes glassy. The city streaks past - grey apartments, neon liquor signs, faceless corner stores - smearing together like wet paint. All she wants is to disappear.\n\nArman stops in front of her building.\n\nARMAN\nThat will be $20.\n\nDante takes a minute to look at him in the rear-view mirror. She is blinking slowly and speaking in slurs.\n\nDANTE\n\nNICE TRY.\n(peering at his tag on the dash)\nWhat's your name?\n\nARMAN\nMy name is Arman, Miss.\n\nDANTE\nIs this fucking joke, Ar-mee?\n\nARMAN\nSorry?\n\nDANTE\nI get your opportunity eye, but you been paid.\n\nARMAN\nNo, Miss. Nobody paid me.\n\nDante takes a moment, looking at him.\n\nDANTE\nTHIS ISN'T FUCKING PAKISTAN, AR-MEE.\n(beat)\nI know these tricks. Don't fuck with me.\n\nARMAN\n(laughing)\n\nOKAY.\n(beat)\nCan I ask, are you okay?\n\nDANTE\nNo. I'm not fucking okay. I'm fucked.\n\nARMAN\nMiss, can I say?\n\nDANTE\nAm I home now?\n\nARMAN\nWhere I come from, a man would never let a woman come home alone like this. Always, you should have a good man with you.\n\nDANTE\n(laughing)\nR-man... where I come from, this is what a good man does.\n\nHe gets out to open her door.\n\nDANTE\nNO! I'll do it.\n\nArman just shakes his head as she smiles and flips him a slow bird.\n\nShe exits the cab on her own (with great difficulty) and heads to the front door of a brownstone building with her middle finger still extended. Her heels are in her hand again and her legs seem to be working less and less.\n\nArman watches her with concern until she enters the building.\n\n\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF APT. DOOR. - JUST PAST 9PM\n\nDante is in front of an apartment door rustling for her keys in her purse. She pulls the keys back and looks at all of them. She notices a new KEY CHAIN. It is two, golden testicles with a mini plaque saying 'He Who Owns the Gold Rules'. She has a brief memory of Abe giving her these telling her she 'needs a pair'.\n\nDante looks up to take the moment in and smiles.\n\nWhen she finally finds her key, she keeps trying the lock and missing while longer transition scenes of black are occurring.\n\nWhen she finally gets the key part of the way in, it doesn't seem to fit.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nWe hear a 'bang' and a 'thump' in the dark...\n\nFADE IN:\n\nDante is lying on her side with her eyes wide open. One eye is quickly swelling. She is looking upward. A trickle of blood starts trailing down her lips from her nose.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n",

He is one of three senior interviewers/executives at BEL Inc., exuding an aura of commanding authority, refined elegance, and barely concealed volatility. He is impeccably dressed, stone-faced in professional settings, and operates with a practiced, almost theatrical control over every interaction. He possesses an uncanny ability to read people, which he leverages as both a professional and personal weapon. Beneath his polished exterior lies a man capable of sudden, explosive outbursts, crude humor, and psychological manipulation, yet also moments of surprising warmth and candor.",

In the interview scene, he poses a morally ambiguous hit-and-run question with cold precision. In his office, he performs a high-pressure broker call with practiced theatricality, using a punching bag and fake frenzy to manipulate a client. At the bar, he oscillates between warm mentor and terrifying authority figure \u2014 sharing a genuine childhood story about his people-reading gift, then pivoting to explosive outbursts about power and wealth, crude anatomical humor, and finally a psychological game about identifying a one-testicled colleague. His speech patterns are characterized by deliberate pacing, rhetorical repetition for emphasis, and a tendency to interrupt others mid-sentence. He issues commands disguised as invitations and delivers rules as non-negotiable edicts.",

She is a senior power broker at BEL Inc., occupying a position of authority above the trading floor. She is impeccably presented, minimalistic in her workspace aesthetic, and operates with a commanding, no-nonsense demeanor that occasionally cracks to reveal warmth and even vulnerability. She is a self-appointed mentor to Dante, guiding her with blunt, sometimes brutal honesty, and is clearly a dominant force in the male-dominated office environment.",
        "dialogue_summary": "Cassandra's dialogue is commanding, blunt, and often simultaneously directed at multiple people or situations (she frequently speaks while on the phone). In the interview scene she asks probing, direct questions. At the bar she delivers a brutal but motivating critique of Dante's appearance and a frank warning about the office's misogyny, framing herself as Dante's necessary ally. At Saks she issues terse directives to Liliane while conducting business calls. Her parting words to Dante outside Saks are cryptic and controlling ('don't ask, don't tell'). In the VIP room she arrives triumphant and celebratory, announcing she has secured the Cane account. Her speech patterns are clipped, declarative, and authoritative, with occasional moments of dry wit.",

        "description": "Dante De La Cruz is a mid-to-late 20s woman of mixed Haitian and Puerto Rican heritage with milk chocolate skin, dark hair, and big brown eyes. She is a newly hired broker-in-training at BEL Inc. in 1997 Manhattan, driven by a traumatic childhood marked by domestic violence and poverty. Fiercely ambitious, street-smart, and emotionally guarded, she is determined to achieve wealth and power so that no one can ever harm or control her again. She is simultaneously raw and resilient, navigating a brutal, chauvinistic financial world while concealing her vulnerabilities behind wit, bravado, and calculated self-control.",
        "dialogue_summary": "Dante's dialogue moves between three registers: guarded ambition (her interview answers about wanting power and wealth), social navigation (attempting to charm or deflect the brokers, warming to Greta and Liliane), and raw vulnerability (her drunken confession to Abe about her family and past). She is often reactive rather than expository, revealing character through action and brief, pointed lines rather than monologue. Her most defining spoken moments are her interview declaration of wanting to be 'somebody nobody can fuck with,' her heel-throwing quip to the trading floor, and her whispered threat to Joaquin in the men's bathroom. Her phone call in the washroom early in the day reveals an unguarded, joyful side she otherwise suppresses. Her drunken cab ride home exposes exhaustion, self-doubt, and dark humor about her origins.",

He is one of three senior interviewers/partners at BEL Inc., affluently dressed and commanding in the office. He is boisterous, crude, sexually inappropriate, and relentlessly humorous in social settings, but reveals a darker, more threatening and volatile side when under the influence of cocaine.",

He uses vulgar nicknames, sexual innuendo, and physical humor to dominate social situations. In professional settings he is terse and pointed. His most revealing dialogue occurs in the washroom, where cocaine strips away his comedic persona and exposes a coercive, racist, and sexually threatening man who attempts to leverage Dante's vulnerability for personal gain. After being physically subdued by Dante, he resorts to calling her a 'bitch' and then publicly ejects her from the bar.",

The office is where Abe orchestrates his manipulative phone tactics with clients like Steven Daniels, demonstrating his practiced deception (fake urgency, stereo tricks). It's also a space where power dynamics play out with employees like Laynah, who must wait on the love seat while Abe conducts business. The brief glimpse of Dante and the blonde woman through the doorway hints at broader office dynamics and Abe's awareness of his surroundings even while focused on deals.",

Large and unwieldy by modern standards, it is given to Dante by Greta as part of her onboarding at BEL Inc. on her first day. The phone is a symbol of Dante's entry into the world of wealth and professional status. Joaquin is also seen wielding two giant Motorola cell phones simultaneously, one to each ear, underscoring the device as a status symbol of power and connectivity among the firm's elite. Cassandra also uses a cell phone throughout the day to manage clients and broker deals.",

For Dante, it represents her first tangible acquisition of professional status and upward mobility \u2014 she calls a loved one on it with pure elation, marking the threshold between her impoverished past and her aspirational future. Cassandra's instruction to keep it on her at all times signals Dante's entry into a world of constant availability and control. For Joaquin, the dual giant Motorolas are an extension of his outsized personality and power, visually communicating his dominance and the firm's culture of excess. The prop grounds the story firmly in 1997 and serves as a recurring emblem of the wealth, connectivity, and status that define BEL Inc.",

His mother is a\nNewfoundlander, and he often uses the accent when\ncracking jokes, which is most of the time.\nA third set of eyes is looking at the woman. This is\nABE, a chronically tired, highly manicured \u2019silver\nfox\u2019 in his 50s.\nThey are all affluently dressed and in 3 expensive leather\noffice chairs.\nAcross from these 3 figures is DANTE (mid-late 20s\nstunning woman with milk chocolate skin).\n\n                                                    3.\n\n\n\nThe room is slightly dark in these last moments before\ndawn.

His desk is sprawling and elegant with\nDOCUMENTS and NEWSPAPERS neatly stacked in various\npiles. We see his PAGER and BEEPER side by side at the\ncorner of the desk. The office is stunning, pristine,\nand nothing short of regal.\n                   LAYNAH (CONT\u2019D)\n          I thought we had a freeze on\n          hiring more women.

He intensely pounds off\na few rounds.\nOn his way back, he turns the STEREO on and cranks\nthe volume. It is the frenzied sound of brokers. He\ngoes to the phone and answers completely out of\nbreath with voice racing. He starts pacing.\n                   ABE (CONT\u2019D)\n            (panting into phone)\n           Steven!

Yes. I understand. You\n          need to calm down Steve.\n          Listen, the London numbers are\n          out, and the market is\n          tanking. The employment\n          numbers came out (panting)\u2026\n          they are weak, and they are\n          low. Now prices are getting\n          jacked up because the storm\n          and power outages have been\n          pooling energy over. EVERYONE\n          is shorting their stock. All\n          my brokers are here early to\n          clean this fucking mess up.\n          We need to get everyone\u2019s\n          tickets in the second the\n          market opens.\n               (holds phone to stereo)\nWe hear the frantic, muffled voice of Steven Daniels on\nthe other line. Abe brings the phone back to his ear.\nWe notice a practiced cadence to Abe\u2019s speech.\n                    ABE (CONT\u2019D)\n               (into phone)\n          Steve, the longer you hold on\n          to the position the worse it\n          will be. Hold on. Let me go\n          to my desk and get out of\n          this frenzy.\n                (slowly turns down volume)\n          Listen. You either get rid of\n          those shares now, or they\n          will be as worthless as a used\n          fucking condom. Are you\n          listening to me? No one will\n          want to buy them. Do you\n          enjoy high quality toilet\n          paper, Daniels? Do you? Tell\n          me.

Abe\u2019s eyes flicker up to her.\nShe quickly wipes the smile off her face. We hear\nDaniels\u2019 muffled rambling again.\n\n                                                    9.\n\n\nAbe sits back down at his desk and reaches for a\nBLANK TICKET while listening.\n             ABE (CONT\u2019D)\n               (into phone)\n          Steven, you sound like you\n          need some relax time.

And take this\n          ticket to Crooked Tits.\nAs Abe is giving Laynah the ticket, we see, through\nthe slightly ajar door, the back of Dante and a very\ncurvy blonde woman stopped in front.\nDante turns and looks at Abe. There is a beat\nbetween them. Abe looks back down to his\nbusiness at hand.\n\nINT. 3RD FLOOR CORRIDOR \u2013 MORNING - CONTINUOUS\nGRETA (GREATNESS), 40s, the office manager (but more\nlike office mother), and her sweet perma-smile, are\ntouring Dante around the building. She has a wholesome\nbeauty about her. In her sing-song voice:\n                    GRETA\n               (pointing to the bottom\n               floor)\n          Now, Abe has 2 offices--\nBAM!

It\u2019s best not to\n          disturb her right now.\nThey walk past an art-deco white DESK with fine\nlines. The area is impeccably clean and minimalistic.\nAny office necessity that you do see is made of clean\nsteel, glass, or is white. Even the TELEVISION is\nbeautiful.\nCassandra is at this desk, on her COMPUTER, on her\nPHONE, watching the morning news, checking her\nPAGER and half-watching the transaction that just\noccurred.\n                    CASSANDRA\n               (firmly into the phone)\n          I said, I will handle it.\n          This one is mine. Trust me.\nWe hear Abe in the adjacent office hanging up his\nphone a moment before Cassandra.\nPrelap:\nWe hear loud whirring and the sound of dial up internet.\n\n\nINT. CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF I.T. DESKS - MORNING\nGreta and Dante are standing in front of 2\nincredibly messy desks in a room full of half-\nrepaired COMPUTERS, SYSTEM UNITS, PRINTERS,\nSCREENS, CORDS, WIRES -- I.T.\nheaven.\n                    GRETA\n          Here we have some of our\n          hardest workers. Our I.T.\n          gentleman are here from dusk\n          \u2019til dawn. If you have any\n          technical questions, these\n          are the brilliant minds to\n          ask.\nShe raises her voice towards the men.\n                    GRETA (CONT\u2019D)\n          Gentleman, this is Dante.\nDante nods in hello at what appears to be the stocky\nguy (JOHN) and the lanky guy (TENNESSEE). Both look\nlike they haven\u2019t seen the light of day for years.\n\n                                                       13.\n\n\nTennessee looks up from one of the desks quickly and\nskittishly looks away while typing. John looks up from\nhis desk, lingers, and winks. He has 4 opened SAUCES\nin front of him and is eating an EGG MCMUFFIN. The\nsauce is all over his chin and shirt.\nGreta beams at them.\n                    GRETA (CONT\u2019D)\n          That is Tennessee...\n          ... and John.\n                    DANTE\n          Nice to meet you both.\n                    JOHN\n               (lewdly sucking the\n               sauce off his Mc Muffin)\n          Hi Dante. Thor.\n               (motions to himself)\nAs they continue around the square of the corridor,\nDante looks down towards the center of the office.\nThis is the pit. It is where all the brokers and\nboard people work. It is full of TV SCREENS, PHONES,\nand large PC COMPUTERS appended on top of large\npillars. The massive CLOCK in the middle of the room\nhas NYC written on top and reads 8:30am. The office\nhas been relatively quiet up until now, save for a few\nbrokers reading the Wall Street Journal quietly at\ntheir desks, as other employees start to file in for\nthe day.\nGreta starts quickly pointing out who is who to Dante.\n                    GRETA\n          Ah, here come some of the\n          brokers. That is Dunaway,\n          Mike, Paul... another Mike...\n\nMIKE THE SHIT, (tall, 30-something broker with a\ntemper), and PAUL \u2018BIG WILLIE\u2019, (humpty-dumpty man\nin his 50s), are snorting laughing. They seem drunk.\nThey look up to see the two ladies. Mike bends Paul\nover the desk and pretends to butt fuck him. They\nswitch and Paul pretends to butt fuck Mike. When\nthey are finished, they start stretching as though\njust waking up.\n                    MIKE THE SHIT\n               (loudly)\n          Ahhhh... thanks buddy. Ready\n          for the day.\n\n                                                      14.\n\n\nThey high five each other and head to their desks,\nacting like it is just normal routine.\n                    GRETA\n               (laughing)\n          Those two are such hams!\n          Don\u2019t pay any mind to them\n          Dante, they just love to make\n          us laugh. You\u2019ll be sitting\n          just above Mike actually.\nThere is more filing in, but Greta keeps walking\ntowards the stairway to the trading pit.\nDante is visibly nervous. Greta softly, yet firmly,\nputs a hand on Dante\u2019s arm.\n                    GRETA (CONT\u2019D)\n          Yes... you\u2019ll be starting out\n          right down there.\n               (pointing to the floor\n               just above Mike, who is\n               now downing a bottle of\n               PEPTO BISMAL)\n          Dunaway will help you get\n          started for the first month\n          or so and --\nCassandra walks up and interrupts Greta\u2019s tour.\n                    CASSANDRA\n          -- Pardon me for interrupting\n          Greta. May I steal Dante\n          away?\nGreta is always accommodating.\n\n                    GRETA\n          Of course, Cassandra. We can\n          finish our tour later.\n               (turning to Dante and\n               taking her hands)\n         You come and see me if you\n         need anything. Ok? I mean\n         that. Anything at all, I am\n         here for you.\nGreta gives Dante a huge hug and hands her coat back to her.\n\n                    DANTE\n          Thank you, Greta. You are so kind.\n\n                                                      15.\n\n\nGreta nods and then walks down the stairs towards the\npit. A few of the guys yell out \"GREATNESSSSSS!\". She is\nsmiling at them and saying her good mornings.\n\n                    CASSANDRA\n          I thought that maybe you and\n          I could get a little\n          breakfast. Are you peckish?\n\n                     DANTE\n          Yes, I am.\n               (beat)\n          Is it ok... for me to just go?\n                    CASSANDRA\n          Everything is always okay\n          when you are with me.\n          Besides, the market is going\n          to be dead for a while. Did\n          you get your office phone?\nDante digs in her cheap PURSE and presents her new\nMotorola phone that Greta gave her earlier. We note\nCassandra looking at her purse with disgust.\nThey smile at each other.\n                    CASSANDRA\n          Wonderful. Be sure to have it\n          on you at all times. We can\n          head out this way.\n\nThey head to the top floor and toward\nthe elevator.\n\n                   CASSANDRA (CONT\u2019D)\n         (yelling to the board person\n             just arriving)\n         Make sure you page any calls\n         from Cane straight to my cell\n         phone. No ifs, ands, or buts.\n              (beat)\n         And keep that JAP bitch off\n         my clients!\nCassandra places a KEY in a brass wall panel of the\nelevator and turns it. The elevator \u2019dings\u2019 with the same\nsound as a cash register.\n\n                                                    16.\n\n\n\n                    CASSANDRA (CONT\u2019D)\n               (slightly embarrassed)\n          Joaquin.\nThe elevator doors open and it is stunning and\nornate. The music is Baroque opera. Other than\nmirrors on all walls, it resembles the Sistine\nChapel. Dante\u2019s face reflects her awe.\nCassandra has a small look of satisfaction on her\nface as she presses \u2019G\u2019. We see on the panel that one\nof the floors has KEY ACCESS only.\nWe hear the \u2019cash register ding\u2019 again as we\nwatch the thick, embossed brass elevator doors\nclose.\n\nINT. GEMINI\u2019S BAR - 8:35AM - CONTINUOUS\nThe doors open into a quiet, empty and low-lit bar. It\nis full of deep mahogany wood and plush, red leather\nBOOTHS. We see that the front door is closed, and the\nwindow shades are drawn. It is clearly before opening\nhours, yet a lone bartender looks up in greeting.\nEMMA, (plain woman in her 20s), smiles at them and\nimmediately grabs a REMOTE CONTROL to turn on the\nmusic (hyper-beat French Techno), and all the TVs. The\nTVs are all set to various news channels. She takes\neverything down to a low volume. Emma does anything\nthe brokers tell her to as they take care of her very\nwell.\nThey take a seat at the wood, and the Emma is over\nimmediately. Cassandra places her pager and beeper\nbeside her hand and checks it periodically when Dante\nis speaking.\n                    CASSANDRA\n               (to Dante)\n          Would you like a\n               juice?\n               (to Emma)\n          Two breakfast juices\n               Emma.\n               (to Dante)\n          I apologize for how stressful\n          those interviews can be. It\u2019s\n          nice to be able to talk with\n          you in a more relaxed\n          atmosphere. How are you\n          feeling thus far?\n\n                                                       17.\n\n\n                    DANTE\n          Good. Very good.\n\n\n                    CASSANDRA\n          You look petrified Dante.\n          Don\u2019t lie to me. Are you\n          scared?\n                    DANTE\n           No, no. I\u2019m very excited.\nTheir \u2019breakfast juices\u2019 arrive and Cassandra\nimmediately takes out a perfectly folded, CLOTH\nNAPKIN from her purse, wipes the rim, and shoots hers\nback. Dante is watching and follows suit almost\nspitting it out as is it basically orange-tinted\npure alcohol.\n                    DANTE (CONT\u2019D)\n               (small choke)\n          I am very grateful to be\n          working for this company. It\n          was really nice of you to\n          vouch --\nWhile gazing at Dante, Cassandra takes 2 fingers and\ntaps the bar, much akin to \"hit me\" in \u201921\u2019.\n                    CASSANDRA\n               (over)\n          --listen, Dante. You should\n          be scared if your plan is to\n          make it alone. You had but a\n          glimpse of the boy\u2019s club up\n          there. It is ferocious and\n          chauvinistic to the extreme.\n          Those men are skin hungry pigs.\n          (beat while looking at Dante)\n          I am going to help you.\nThe next 2 breakfast juices arrive. Cassandra wipes the\nrim again and shoots her drink. Dante follows suit. She\nis eying Dante up and down.\n                    CASSANDRA (CONT\u2019D)\n          First off, throw out that\n          ridiculous perfume you are\n          wearing. It\u2019s fake, d\u00e9class\u00e9,\n          and it stunk up the entire\n          office.

Second,\n          you need new hair. Right now,\n          it looks like a nest with a\n          rat\u2019s tail sewn into it.\n          Your make-up... did Tammy Faye\n          Bakker come out with a new\n          J.C. Penny line? Do me a\n          favor and don\u2019t show up in\n          your fucking Mexican prom\n          dress tomorrow. And we need\n          to work on your poker face \u2026\n          Do you need to fart?\n\nDante strained smile appears stuck in position.\n             CASSANDRA (CONT\u2019D)\n          Now, I have been looking for\n          a strong, intelligent,\n          attractive woman to join\n          forces with...\nCassandra looks Dante up and down. She taps the bar\nagain with 2 fingers with her eyes steady on Dante,\nassessing.\n             CASSANDRA (CONT\u2019D)\n          ... and this company is\n          suffering from great\n          deficiencies in that\n          department.\n               (beat)\n          But I think you are moldable.\nDante looks scared and uneasy. Cassandra is watching the\nbartender approach.\n             CASSANDRA (CONT\u2019D)\n          I need you to cut this scared\n          little girl shit and pull it\n          together.\n               (beat)\n          You were hired because I have\n          a good feeling about you,\n          Dante. I need you to trust me\n          and do what I say. Always. Do\n          exactly what I say.\nTwo more breakfast juices arrive. Cassandra taps the\nbar again with 2 fingers and makes a \u2019cut off\u2019 line\nwith her index finger.\n\n                                                      19.\n\n\n                 DANTE\n         Should we get some menus?\nThe bartender laughs quietly to herself and walks\naway. Cassandra wipes the rim, shoots her drink, as\ndoes Dante again. Cassandra maintains her composure as\nthough she\u2019s had nothing to drink. Dante is already\nbeginning to show her state.\n                  CASSANDRA\n          Food contaminates the mind.\n          Now... I have a friend on 5th\n          Avenue who can get you\n          started. Let\u2019s consider this a\n          welcome gift. From me to you.\nDante has no idea what she is talking about. Two more\ndrinks arrive. The bartender walks off. Cassandra wipes\nthe rim and turns to Dante. She holds up her drink with\na smile.\n\n\n                    CASSANDRA (CONT\u2019D)\n          Your face Dante, relax your\n          face. To the start of a\n          stinking rich partnership.\nBefore Dante can respond, Cassandra has shot her\ndrink, stood up and is turning to leave.\nDante drinks and watches Cassandra walking away.\nCassandra turns and slaps the top of her hip once.\nWith that, Dante scrambles up from her seat and\nheads towards Cassandra.\n\nThe somewhat blurry Emma is helping a couple of new\narrivals that she recognizes from the trading floor.\nEmma looks up, smiles and waves, and starts making her\nway around the bar. She gestures to encourage Dante to\nleave with Cassandra quickly. Dante smiles and turns\nto exit.\nTHUD! The door shuts in her face.\n\nEXT. GEMINI\u2019S BAR \u2013 STREET - CONTINUOUS\nCassandra is on her cell phone and hailing a cab\noutside, not looking back for Dante. It is cold and\ngray.\n\n                                                     20.\n\n\nThe exterior bar door opens, and Dante is scurrying\ntowards her. Dante quickly notices that she forgot her\ncoat on the bar stool and quickly turns back to grab\nher coat...\n\nTHUD! CLICK! The door closes and locks behind her. As\nshe goes to knock, she hears Cassandra slap the side\nof the cab loudly. Dante turns and hurries towards the\nCAB.\n\n                      END OF ACT ONE\n\n                                                       21.\n\n\n                        ACT TWO\n\nEXT. SAK\u2019S FIFTH AVE - MORNING\nA yellow taxi pulls up in front of Sak\u2019s Fifth Ave.\nCassandra and Dante step out of the cab. Cassandra is\non the phone, and Dante looks like a kid in a candy\nstore.\nCassandra hangs up her phone call as they head towards\nthe front door.\n\nEXT. SAK\u2019S FIFTH AVE FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS\nThe Saks Fifth Avenue sales manager smiling in greeting.\nLILIANE, (slight, 60-something, exquisitely coiffed\nfemale), is from the pre-plastic surgery generation\nand wears her age gracefully. She is gracious, kind\nand accommodating to her rich clients. She looks\nDante up and down and smiles quaintly.\n                    LILIANE\n          I trust this visit is for\n          your new friend, Cassandra?\nCassandra smiles. Liliane unlocks and opens the door.\n\n                    LILIANE (CONT\u2019D)\n          After you, ladies.\nCassandra slips in quickly. As Dante walks in, she\nattempts to cover her awe. Liliane locks the door\nagain behind them.\n                    CASSANDRA\n          Liliane, this is Dante. Dante\n          is a new broker at the firm.\n          Please have her appearance\n          reflect this.\nCassandra passes Liliane her BLACK VISA CARD. Dante\nlooks from Cassandra to Liliane with bewilderment.\n                    LILIANE\n          Of course, Ms. Constantine.\n          It will be my absolute\n          pleasure.\nWhile dialing the phone, Cassandra pauses to look up\nat Dante.\n\n                                                       22.\n\n\n                   CASSANDRA\n            Have fun.\nLiliane takes Dante\u2019s arm in hers and leads her down\nthe hall. They stop at a wall near the front entrance\nand Liliane opens a steel box with a key from her\nGIANT KEY RING. She flicks on the light switches\ninside. The entire store illuminates further and they\nenter the adjacent elevator.\nMuch like the shopping scenes in Pretty Women, there\nare various montages of Liliane dressing Cassandra in\nbeautiful CLOTHING, SHOES, MAKE-UP, and even attempts\nto re-style Dante\u2019s hair.\nCassandra is there, on the phone the entire time,\napproving or disapproving everything. All that she\napproves would be considered incredibly provocative.\nDante comes out with her final make-over and truly\nlooks like a high-end prostitute.\n                  CASSANDRA\n          Client entertaining outfit.\n          Memorize this.\n               (into phone)\n          Fucktard, I told you to not\n          let that JAP bitch talk to\n          Cane.\nDante comes out with a provocative yet conservative\noutfit.\n             CASSANDRA (CONT\u2019D)\n          Office-wear. You can keep\n          that one on.\n               (somewhat to herself)\n          Joaquin will appreciate this\n          one.\n               (into phone)\n          No, not you. Listen, I am\n          going to rip your eyes out and\n          shove them up your ass when I\n          get there.\nCassandra looks to Liliane and gives her the \u2019bill\nplease\u2019 symbol with her index and thumb. Liliane nods and\ncompletes the sale. Cassandra signs while on the phone.\nDante is standing in the mirror, flushed with\nexcitement. She has never worn clothes this expensive\nbefore.\n\n                                                       23.\n\n\nLiliane comes around the counter to show them out.\nDante puts on her new, FAUX FUR-COLLARED TRENCH COAT.\nLiliane unlocks the door and opens it.\n\n                  LILIANE\n          It was lovely to meet you,\n          Dante. Any friend of Ms.\n          Constantine is a friend of\n          ours. Please come see us for\n          anything you need.\nLiliane shakes Dante\u2019s hand with both her hands. She\nhas pressed her personal business card into Dante\u2019s\nhand. Dante takes a quick look at the card and smiles.\nCassandra reaches out and closes Dante\u2019s hand again.\nShe gives her a look as though to say, don\u2019t be tacky.\nCassandra suddenly looks a bit flushed and seems to\nhave become a bit flustered. She almost looks soft. As\nthough she notices, her face suddenly hardens again,\nshe releases Dante\u2019s hand and quickens the exit.\n                   CASSANDRA\n          Thank you, Liliane. You are a\n          gem.   Now,    I    have   an\n          appointment with a client,\n          so I must be off.\nCassandra turns around and leaves.\n\n                    DANTE\n          Thank you, Ms. Liliane. I\n          really appreciate your help.\n                    LILIANE\n          They will be delivered to\n          your office today. Would you\n          like your original clothing\n          delivered as well?\nDante takes a moment to consider.\n\n                    DANTE\n          No, thank you Liliane. You can\n          burn those.\nLiliane smiles graciously and lets her out the front\ndoor. As Dante leaves, we see her look back. Liliane\nis still standing at the door smiling and nodding in\ngoodbye. Dante smiles warmly back.\n\n                                                       24.\n\n\nEXT. SAK\u2019S FIFTH AVE - LATE MORNING - CONTINUOUS\n\nDante turns and we see that she is surrounded by a sea\nof swarming taxis. The streets are steamy as the sun\nis now beaming brightly down on this glorious winter\nday in NYC. Dante takes a deep breath and smiles.\nAs she scans the bustling city scene for Cassandra, we\nsee her getting into a cab. Dante walks towards her,\nsomewhat unsteady in her new heels.\nCassandra sees her and lowers her window. She has her\nphone in her hand that she uses emphatically.\n                     CASSANDRA\n           One more thing Dante... don\u2019t\n           you dare puke tonight. I\u2019ve spent\n           a lot of fucking money on you.\n             (beat)\n          You look good.\n             (beat; intense)\n          Oh, and Dante... don\u2019t ask,\n          don\u2019t tell.\n             (beat)\n          You should get back to work.\nCassandra tells the cab driver where to go while\nsimultaneously answering her ringing phone and putting\nthe window up. The cab takes off before Dante can\nrespond.\nCassandra\u2019s cab whizzes off leaving Dante\nstranded, confused, yet strangely empowered.\nAfter a beat, she starts to hail a cab.\n\nEXT. TWIN TOWERS\nDante gets out of the cab and looks up at the towers.\nShe takes a deep breath and smiles before walking in.\n\nINT. BEL INC. OFFICE - 11:30AM\nDING! The elevator doors open and we see Dante struggling\nto walk in her new HIGH HEELS.\nDante looks around. She has never seen anything like\nit in her life. There are well over 30 brokers\nspeaking on their phones simultaneously. Some are\nshouting at computer screens, some at TV screens,\nsome at each other.\n\n                                                       25.\n\n\nThey are wading in a sea of white, crumpled, tiny\nPAPER droppings.\nShe appears frozen in her tracks, as she has no idea\nwhat to do or where to go.\nGreta sees her coming and goes straight to her.\n                    GRETA\n          Ah!   You    look    absolutely\n          stunning. It is so wonderful to\n          have another female around\n          here, and a beautiful one at\n          that.\n\n                  DANTE\n          Thank you, Greta. I hope I\n          wasn\u2019t gone too long. I\n          couldn\u2019t seem to hail a\n          cab...\n                  GRETA\n          I wouldn\u2019t worry about that.\n          You still don\u2019t know how\n          things work around here.\nGreta gives Dante a little wink.\n\n\n                  GRETA (CONT\u2019D)\n          Well, shall we continue our\n          tour? Show off this beautiful\n          outfit!\n                  DANTE\n          Yes... I, uh, did a little\n          shopping...\n                  GRETA\n          Wise choice, love. Well, we\n          might as well start with my\n          office.\nGreta starts to walk down the hall, beckoning Dante to\njoin her.\nThey head up the stairs to the 3rd level towards a\ndesk facing the pit.\n\n                                                       26.\n\n\nINT. BEL INC. - GRETA\u2019S DESK - MORNING\n\nGreta\u2019s desk is beautiful. Her area is decorated in\nmostly yellow. It is very cozy and somehow feels like\na country home. As soon as Dante enters, Greta,\nseemingly psychic, has already poured her a giant\nGLASS of water and hands her a TYLENOL. She picks up\na box of BAND-AIDS and removes two.\n                  GRETA\n          Self-care is key. Always take\n          care of yourself first.\nGreta looks at her intently. Dante nods and downs the\nwater and pill, while Greta kneels and puts the band-\naids on the backs of her ankles.\n                  DANTE\n               (looking down at Greta)\n          I think I\u2019m starting to\n          understand why everyone calls\n          you \u2019Greatness\u2019.\nGreta looks up at her with a large smile.\n                  GRETA\n          Let\u2019s leave that coat in my\n          office for now.\n\nDante hands her the coat and Greta hangs it on a hook.\nINT. BEL INC. CORRIDOR - RIGHT OF THE PIT (CONTINUOUS)\nAs they leave her office, we see that Greta is proud\nof her position, and it shows. She is aware of\neveryone around her and what they are doing -- even\nif she doesn\u2019t acknowledge it.\n                    GRETA\n               (pointing at the desk\n               they just left)\n          I am usually on the top\n          level, but if you don\u2019t see\n          me there, don\u2019t worry. Leave\n          me a note and I will get back\n          to you as soon as I can.\nAs they head back down the stairs, Dante and Greta\nsee the SHOE REPAIR GUY, (small, 50-something,\nnervous looking Italian man), frantically buffing\nAbe\u2019s shoes. No one knows his actual name, nor do\nthey seem to care. Abe is reading the NEWSPAPER and\ndoesn\u2019t look up.\n\n                                                      27.\n\n\n                    ABE\n          Make sure you have new laces\n          for me tomorrow.\n                    SHOE REPAIR GUY\n          You got \u2019er Mr. Hinkley.\nGreta gestures towards the Shoe Repair Guy and Abe.\n                    GRETA\n          You should know that Joaquin\n          insists that everyone has\n          their shoes buffed on\n          Thursdays. In fact, it is\n          company policy. You will see\n          that in \u2019the book\u2019 you\n          receive tomorrow.\nDante smiles. She has never, in her entire life,\nhad anything polished for her.\nAbe peers over his newspaper and looks Dante up and\ndown. Dante becomes so flustered that she trips towards\nGreta. Greta catches her. Abe looks down at his\nnewspaper.\n                    GRETA (CONT\u2019D)\n          Oopsies! I\u2019ve got you Dante.\n          It looks like you may need a\n          little more help walking for\n          a bit.\nGreta smiles and takes her arm. Dante is flushed with\nembarrassment as she looks back to Abe. Only, Abe\nseems to be gone, and we see XANDER, (handsome, shy,\n30-something man), just sitting down in his spot.\n\n                    XANDER\n          Just what\u2019s necessary, please.\n                    SHOE REPAIR GUY\n          You got it, Mr. Lavery.\nAs the shoe repair guy shakes his head and gets to\nwork, Xander looks up at Dante \u2019walking\u2019. Greta is\nmoving her along.\nGreta is pointing to an elevator. She is speaking\nloudly as they are right in front of the pit where\nbrokers are shouting at their various technologies.\nEach of them is outfitted with a beeper, and each\nmanager is outfitted with a pager and a beeper. We\nhear these beeping and vibrating randomly constantly.\n\n                                                         28.\n\n\n                      GRETA\n            As you are allowed 5-minute\n            smoke breaks, you can take\n            that elevator down to \u2019P\u2019 to\n            the smoking cage.\n            The cafeteria is on the 30th\n            floor, the mall is on the\n            train level.\n                 (she points to an\n                 elevator across from\n                 them on the floor below)\n            Never use this one. This one is for\n            executives only.\n\nGreta gives her a gentle but knowing smile.\n\n                      DANTE\n            Ummm\u2026I don\u2019t smoke?\n                        GRETA\n            You will.\n  They move past the elevator and Greta points to a spot\n  above the pit. It is all mirrored windows, including\n  the door.\n                    GRETA\n            That is Joaquin\u2019s office. You\n            may not be able to see in,\n            but rest assured, if he\u2019s in\n            his office, he is always\n            watching. It\u2019s best not to\n            disturb him...\n                 (beat)\n            ... ever.\n  Greta smiles again and takes her towards the pit. She\n  points to the back offices behind it.\n\n\n                    GRETA\n            In those back offices are\n            Tina and Benny. They receive\n            your tickets and take care of\n            it from there.\n  CROOKED TITS (mousy woman in her 40s), looks up from\n  her desk. Her eyes squint at Dante. She looks\n  unimpressed, purses her lips and looks back down.\n  Benny, (late 30s, handsome and unassuming), looks up\n  and smiles.\n\n                                                       29.\n\n\nDante is clinging to Greta\u2019s arm for support. Some\nbrokers are starting to turn and are laughing amongst\neach other. Greta and Dante stop in front of the pit.\n\n                  GRETA\n              (claps her hands)\n          Everyone! Listen up!\nWe see and hear the muffled sounds of about 30\nbrokers putting their clients on hold. We see Laynah\non the phone with her back to Dante and Greta. She\nturns around, looks Dante up and down, then turns to\nresume her phone call. All other eyes are on Dante.\n                  GRETA\n          This is Dante. This is her\n          first day...\nWe see that the brokers are a bit confused and looking\nat each other.\n                    GRETA\n               (teasingly)\n          ... so, you bad boys be good\n          to her. She is a very, very\n          sweet girl and needs a hearty\n          welcome from all of you.\n               (she gives a look to a\n               couple of the brokers)\nDante nervously looks around. All is quiet except\nthe muffled voice of Laynah in the background.\nThe crowd erupts. It is like a Circus of Idiots. Each\nidiot encouraging the next with some whistling at Dante.\nOne broker starts imitating Dante\u2019s walk crudely.\n                    MIKE THE SHIT\n          Don\u2019t worry Dante, I love the\n          handicapped!\n\nAnother is bobbing his head up and down between\nanother broker\u2019s legs.

YES. YESSSSS!!!! I LOVE YOU\n          DANTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I would love to\n          see a little more of your\n          neckline...I mean, chest\n          line. Fuck it.

I\u2019m ready to learn\n          everything I can.\nThe room is quiet save for a few brokers piping up to say\nimmature shit like, \"shower! shower!\", \"$100 to you if it\nsticks!\" while a broker is holding up a quarter or\nflicking their tongues between their \u2019v\u2019 fingers at their\nmouth.\nWe are unsure if she is going to speak again. Slowly, she\ntakes off her heels. There's a moment where they wonder\nif she's going to strip. For once, it quiets everyone.\nLaynah peers over.\n\n                  DANTE\n          And... you should know that I\n          may not know how to use these\n          for walking ...\n               (holds up a HIGH HEEL)\n          but, I certainly know how\n          to use them as a weapon.\n\n                                                    31.\n\n\nWithout skipping a beat, Dante swiftly whips it like a\nthrowing star towards the cork board at the opposite\nwall, hitting a paper perfectly in the center. We see\nthat it is a defaced PICTURE OF CLINTON. The crowd is\nquiet and then erupts into voracious laughter, whooping\nand clapping before resuming their phone calls.\nGreta turns to Dante and winks.\n                  GRETA\n          Well played. I think that you\n          will fit in here just fine.\nGreta starts walking her to her new desk. Dante is\nwalking steady and confident in her bare feet, one heel\nin hand. The men are all back on their calls and a\ncouple even turn to Dante with approving nods.\nThe defaced picture of Clinton falls unceremoniously to\nthe ground.\n\nINT. 2ND LEVEL TRADING PIT - DANTE\u2019S DESK\nThey reach Dante\u2019s desk - it is curved, institutional,\nand battle-scarred. Laminate top chipped at the edges,\nscratched from years of frantic notetaking. Built like a\ntank to withstand the daily assault of Wall Street\nintensity.\nWe see YURI,(40-something man with salt-and-pepper hair),\nat the desk beside, face down, and one pant leg wet on\nthe inside.\n                  GRETA\n          I\u2019ll be right back. This will\n          be your desk. So, please make\n          yourself comfortable.\nGreta swiftly exits and Dante takes a moment to look\naround and take in her surroundings. The people, the\noffice, the din, the chaos. She smiles and places her\nnew purse on her desk.\nMike the Shit looks up from the desk on the floor\nimmediately below and pipes up.\n\n                                                     32.\n\n\n\n                  MIKE THE SHIT\n                    (into phone)\n          Holy shit! Everyone is on the\n          phone right now buying Cisco\n          up! Let me call my supervisor\n          over to\n          pre-approve you for more shares...\nMike hits the hold button and puts the phone to his chest.\n                  MIKE THE SHIT (CONT\u2019D)\n          Hey Laynah, I thought Abe\n          told you to leave your dirty\n          man whores at home? This one\n          pissed himself!\nLaynah, mid-phone dial, peeks out from the other side\nof Mike\u2019s desk.\n                    LAYNAH\n          This one is a welcome present\n          for our \u2019new broker\u2019.\nWe see Greta rushing back like a Geisha to her top\nclient. She has a fresh pair of SLACKS in one hand\nand a GLASS OF WATER in another. She is back in an\nabnormally fast time.\n                    LAYNAH (CONT\u2019D)\n                  (to Dante)\n          You may wanna have Greta take\n          this one to the cleaners\n          first.\nFor the first time, Dante sees a slightly unimpressed\nlook on Greta\u2019s face as she ignores Laynah\u2019s comment.\nMike and Laynah are back on their phones.\nGreta picks up his head, shoves a strange colored pill\nin his mouth and force feeds him the water. She has her\nback to Dante to try and create some privacy with the\nscene.\n                    GRETA\n          Come now Yuri. Let\u2019s get you\n          cleaned up.\n\nGreta helps him up while he mumbles what sounds\nlike Russian and starts grabbing at her breasts.\n\n                                                       33.\n\n\n                   YURI\n              (in Russian)\n          Boobies\u2026\n\nGreta turns her head back to Dante for a moment.\n\n\n                   GRETA\n          Tennie will get you set up. I\n          hope you can excuse me.\n                   DANTE\n          Of course.\nDante turns back to her desk to see Tennessee. He is\nalready into her computer typing madly. Things seem to\nmove incredibly fast around here. He doesn\u2019t acknowledge\nher.\nShe looks down at Mike the Shit, who is leaned back in\nhis chair on the phone, looking at her. He turns back\ntowards his computer, talking to his client.\nIn the background, she sees Abe standing by a post. He\nhas one hand in a slight fist, elegantly placed just\nin front of his chest, and the other arm behind him.\nThe calmness that he exudes is in stark contrast to\nthe frenzy of the crowd.\nHe has been watching her, but we have no idea for how\nlong. He lifts a finger and beckons her over.\n                    DANTE\n          Excuse me, Tennessee.\n                    TENNESSEE\n          Tennie. Only my mom calls me\n          by my full name.\nTennie doesn\u2019t look up from the computer screen. Other\nthan what he said, he seems barely aware of anyone\u2019s\npresence.\nShe heads over immediately.\n                    ABE\n          I\u2019m taking you to lunch Dante.\nSeemingly more like a command than a request, Dante\nquickly eyes the clock. It is almost 1pm. Abe\u2019s gaze\nis steady and unreadable.\n\n                                                       34.\n\n\n                   DANTE\n          Yes, of course, Abe. Let me\n          grab my purse.\n                   ABE\n          That won\u2019t be necessary.\nHe smiles for the first time at her. A smile that is\nimpossible to read. From behind his back, he produces\nher \u2019throwing star\u2019 missing heel as well as her coat\nthat she left at the bar. Dante sheepishly takes her\nitems back.\n                    DANTE\n             (laughing nervously)\n          No shirt, no shoes, no service?\nHe turns and glides like an electric eel through the\nbrokers. Dante quickly follows behind like a lost\nduckling, high heels in hand. Without looking behind\nhim:\n                    ABE\n          And put your god damn shoes on.\nDante scrambles to put her heels on only to re-commence\nher awkward walk. She hears snickering behind her.\nThey head to the broker elevator this time rather than\nthe Michaelangelean executive elevator she took with\nCassandra.\nDante slips in and stands beside Abe just as the door\nis about to close. He is stoic and refined. She is\nflustered and sweaty.\nDING! The doors close.\n\n                         END OF ACT TWO\n\n                                                       35.\n\n\n                          ACT THREE\n\nINT. GEMINI\u2019S BAR - 1PM\nEmma is smiling. The scene mirrors exactly what we saw\na few hours prior with Dante and Cassandra - same\nseats, different meeting. There is a \u2019Groundhog\u2019s Day\u2019\nfeel for a beat. Abe\u2019s pager and beeper are on the bar\nbetween them, and he checks them periodically when\nDante is speaking.\n                    ABE\n          Would you like an orange\n               juice?\n             (he eyes his watch)\n          It\u2019s still morning.\nDante feels immediately sick. Abe nods to the\nbartender as she goes off to makes the drinks.\n\n\n                    DANTE\n          I... I would love one.\n          I always start the day with a\n          juice. You know, a kick of\n          vitamin C to keep my immune\n          system strong --\n                    ABE\n          -- How is your first day\n          going so far?\n            (looks her up and down)\n          I see that you are very\n          comfortable with your new\n          position.\nEmma arrives just in time with what looks like the\nexact same drinks as earlier. Dante, grateful this\ntime, shoots it back. Abe takes a small and graceful\nsip.\n                  ABE\n          Dante. Take it easy. It\u2019s\n          still early.\n                    DANTE\n          Sorry. I guess I was thirsty.\n          Uh, maybe I\u2019ll just get a\n          tea?\n                    ABE\n          No. You\u2019ll get another juice,\n          but you\u2019ll pace yourself.\n\n                                                    36.\n\n\n                      DANTE\n          Yes, sir.\n                  ABE\n          -- Sir? What happened to the\n          girl earlier this morning who\n          was spouting off about money,\n          power, and prestige?\n               (he laughs)\n          You didn\u2019t even have shoes on\n          10 minutes ago.\nAbe smiles at her.\n                    ABE (CONT\u2019D)\n          Go ahead and order another.\nDante tries to catch Emma\u2019s eye and starts tapping the\nbar with two fingers. Tap tap. Tap TAP. Abe appears\nto be scrutinizing her methods, adding to her\nnervousness.\nTAP TAP TAP TAP!\nEmma is at the other end chatting up another customer.\nDante puts her fingers in her mouth and whistles. Abe\ngrabs her hand out of her mouth and pulls it down to\nthe bar, holding it tightly. Emma shoots her a glare.\n                    ABE\n          That, you shall never do again.\n                    DANTE\n          Right. Sorry.\nWhilst still holding Dante\u2019s hand and gaze, he\nelegantly taps his fingers on the bar twice. If you\nsaw only this moment in time, you would think that\nAbe is training a monkey. Emma starts preparing their\ndrinks. Dante looks mortified.\n                    ABE\n          (still gripping her hand)\n          Let\u2019s hear your story.\nDante hiccups and covers her mouth, mortified.\n                    DANTE\n                (embarrassed)\n          Well, breakfast booze is new to me.\nDante shifts in her seat, trying to find a nonchalant\nway to get her hand back.\n\n                                                       37.\n\n\n                  ABE\n          Let\u2019s hear the parts of your\n          story that aren\u2019t glaringly\n          obvious.\n                   (beat)\n          Wait. Let me guess.\nAbe is looking at her studiously.\nThe drinks arrive and Abe doesn\u2019t break his gaze.\nDante looks to Emma apologetically. Emma glowers and\nwalks away.\nHe continues to study her up and down slowly. Taking\nhis time at each body part. Dante instinctively closes\nher body inwards. Abe reaches forward and slowly\nunwinds her.\n\nHe takes all of her in before leaning forward. In\nvampirish fashion, he inhales her decolletage deeply\nand slowly. There is an extended beat as we see his\nmouth slowly open by her neck.\n                  ABE\n          ... pine-sol soap...\n             (inhales again)\n          ahhh...there is a perfume...\n          yes... Lysol. Dumpy-ass motel scent.\n\nHe tightens his grip on her hand. She winces.\n\n          Am I right?\n              (beat)\n          Wait...\n               (fondling a tag left on\n               her suit jacket)\n          Mmmmmm...\n               yes --\nAbe sits back and finally releases the tight grip on\nher hand.\n                    ABE\n          -- Cassandra popped your Saks\n          cherry.\nDante immediately pulls her hand in and\ninstinctively massages it.\nDante is looking back at him blankly.\nAbe breaks into a somewhat demented and creepy laughter.\n\n                                                      38.\n\n\nHe slaps Dante on the back.\n                     ABE\n             (off her reaction)\n          I\u2019m just trying to get a rise\n          out of you.\n              (beat)\n          Seriously. I would like to\n          hear your story.\nDante is clearly in way over her head and is trying to\nstay in control. Abe taps the bar for 2 more juices.\n\n                    DANTE\n          Ah, two more juices.\n          Excellent.\nWhile she is speaking, Abe is pulling out a giant\nWAD OF MONEY in a gold MONEY CLIP. Each bill seems\nto be a $100 bill, and there appear to be about 1.5\ninches of them. Emma places a fresh juice in front\nof each of them.\nAbe unfurls his wad and passes Emma a few of the bills.\n                    ABE\n          (over)-- Let\u2019s keep \u2019em\n          coming for the rest of the\n          day Emma.\nAbe takes another quick look at Dante.\n                  ABE\n               (off Dante)\n          Let\u2019s make that day, and\n          night. BEL-Style.\n\nHe flicks another couple hundreds at her. It doesn\u2019t\nseem to diminish the wad thickness at all. Emma smiles\nprofessionally and heads off to make another round.\nEmma doesn\u2019t seem fazed by the amount of money just\nthrown at her.\n                  ABE\n          Go on...\n\nINT. GEMINI\u2019S BAR VIP ROOM - LATER\nDante and Abe are deep in conversation in a private VIP\nroom booth. Abe\u2019s scotch glass is half-empty and\nDante\u2019s scotch glass is full. Dante is visibly drunk,\nand she is eating the last of the pretzels in a bowl\nright in front of her.\n\n                                                    39.\n\n\n                  DANTE\n          --that\u2019s why I work as hard\n          as I do. Let\u2019s just say I\n          learned early that no one was\n          gonna hand me anything. I\n          will never go back...\n          Excuse me --\n               (crying)\n          -- Sorry, I don\u2019t\n          usually...\nAbe passes her a napkin off the table. She dabs below\nher eyes, somewhat missing part of the make-up in her\nstate.\n                  DANTE\n          Shit. I hate talking about my\n          family.\n            (studying him intensely)\n          I never talk about this\n          stuff.\nDante looks to Abe as he nods politely. He seems like a\ndifferent person than before - soft, kind, heartfelt\neven.\nDante dabs below her eyes again and blows her nose with\nthe napkin. She takes a deep breath and collects herself.\n                  DANTE\n          Can I tell you something Abe?\n\n                  ABE\n          Sure thing.\nDante leans in.\n                 DANTE\n         I have never worn heels in my\n         entire life.\n             (beat)\n         Shhhhhhhh...\n\nAbe takes a moment to look at her incredulously.\n                  ABE\n          Oh. Oh.\n             (patting himself down)\n          Give me a moment here to\n          find my surprise face.\n\n                                                       40.\n\n\nThey have a laugh together and we see Dante clearly\nrelieved at the lightness she has found with Abe. We\nsee the bartender bringing over new DRINKS plus 2\nSHOTS. She sets them on the table and cleans the\nempties off.\n                 DANTE\n         Ugh. I\u2019m sick of talking\n         about my life.\n             (studying Abe\u2019s face)\n         How did you really know about\n         my past?\nAbe takes a moment to consider his response. He takes\na large sip of his drink and downs his shot. Dante\ndowns her shot as well.\n                 ABE\n         I have a knack. I can read\n         people.   I used to think\n         everybody could do it.\n                 DANTE\n         Yah. No.\n\n                 ABE\n         I learned that during my first\n         fist fight in grade 7. I was\n         small for my age, so when I\n         entered junior high, the\n         taller boys started to pick\n         on me.\n              (beat)\n         There was one gang, The\n         Bloodgang, not very original\n         I know, that\n         was... particularly\n         intimidating. One day, the\n         leader, Civatrelli, and his 4\n         thug friends gathered around\n         me in a circle. To further\n         the clich\u00e9, they wanted my\n         lunch money. Civatrelli was\n         punching my shoulder to\n         weaken my will. (beat) I\n         don\u2019t know how else to\n         explain this, but suddenly,\n         all I saw was... truth. It\n         was almost as though I could\n         see a life map inside of him.\n              (beat)\n         I went on to tell him about\n         (MORE)\n\n                                          41.\n\n\n                  ABE (CONT\u2019D)\n          his whore mother, who cheated\n          on his father, with his best\n          friend. And, when he was left\n          home alone with his uncle,\n          while his mom was off\n          whoring, his uncle was\n          diddling him in his bed.\n               (beat)\n          The shock on their faces was\n          my first indication that\n          there was something unique\n          about what I could see. I\n          don\u2019t know if I just read\n          people well or if it is some\n          extra-sensory gift.\n                    DANTE\n          So, what happened?\n                    ABE\n          Oh... I had the living SHIT\n          beat out of me.

How they just took\n          whatever they wanted. I\n          studied them for the rest of\n          the year, spying on their\n          bullying. Eventually, I\n          became a part of their\n          group... their secret weapon,\n          if you will.\n                    DANTE\n          So, this is your secret to\n          your success?\n\n                    ABE\n          I would say that is part of\n          it, yes. I learned a lot\n          about the power of knowing\n          the truth that day.

It\nis starting to fill. Her eyes settle on a 30-\nsomething, incredibly handsome male at the end of the\nbar. Abe turns to study him intensely.\n\n                    ABE (CONT\u2019D)\n          Mmm. Wanna-be. Bullshit bar\n          stool philosopher. I\u2019d say\n          a... substitute teacher.\n          Hoping to be noticed by a\n          higher up in our business to\n          make the amount of money he\n          tells the ladies he makes.\n          (beat) Player.

My guess would be a\n          high-end escort. Daddy ran\n          off with a younger woman when\n          she was just a child. Mother\n          raised her and her 5 siblings\n          alone on a cashier\u2019s wage.

Don\u2019t try\n         to be like anyone else in\n         this firm. If I wanted a\n         fucking clone, I would\u2019ve\n         gone to the Roslin Institute.\n         But, if you do want to\n         emulate someone, then\n         continue to follow Cassandra.\n         That woman knows how to make\n         money.\n              (beat)\n         Oh, and never ask me a\n         question twice.

He sits back\nand calms himself. He takes a small POCKET SQUARE from\nhis suit pocket and serenely wipes his upper lip.

They're greeting him like old\n  friends. Dante's laugh is bitter - she realizes she's\n  been conned.\n                      DANTE\n                (to the brokers)\n            I need... I need to use the\n            washroom. Excuse me.\n\n\nINT. GEMINIS WASHROOM\n\n  Dante stares at her blurry reflection in the mirror. A\n  silent pep talk seems to be taking place as she glances\n  toward the door - weighing her escape. She looks back at\n  the mirror, studying her drunken reflection for a few\n  beats. Stay or go?\n\n  Her expression shifts - from uncertainty to something\n  deeper. Whatever she's thinking about, it's bigger than\n  this moment. Her jaw sets with quiet determination. Two\n  years. She only needs two years.\n\n  She takes her pulse at her wrist - elevated. Pulls down\n  her lower lip in the mirror, checking circulation.\n\n  Knowing she has a narrow window before full absorption,\n  she kneels by the toilet and forces herself to vomit.\n\n                                                         48.\n\n\n  Back at the sink, she turns on the tap and drinks heavily\n  from her cupped hands, rehydrating. She pulls a granola\n  bar from her purse and devours it to slow any remaining\n  alcohol absorption.\n\n  She takes a deep breath, straightens her shoulders, and\n  heads back out.\n\nINT. PRIVATE VIP ROOM - GIANT BOOTH - 5PM\n  Dante is sandwiched in the middle of a semi-circle in\n  the booth between Dunaway (sweet, shy, geeky broker\n  in his 20s) Mike the Shit, Mike Christian (tall,\n  sweet, even-tempered broker in his 30s) and Yuri (who\n  looks as though he has seen better days). In the\n  center of the table are ICE BINS chilling 3 BOTTLES\n  OF VEUVE.\n  There are many, many SHOOTERS on the table, all still\n  full. In fact, every inch is filled. In this sea of\n  shooters, we see 4 FLUTE GLASSES.\n  Dunaway reaches over and grabs a Veuve.\n\n                    MIKE THE SHIT\n            Can we pop this for you?\n  The boys snicker.\n                      DANTE\n            I\u2019d like to see you try.\n  The group gives a bit of an \u2019ooooooohhhh, ahhhhhhh\u2019\n  and laughs.\n  Dunaway tries to pop the cork. He cannot seem to get it.\n\n                      MIKE CHRISTIAN\n            Seriously? Pass that over.\n  He grabs the bottle from Dunaway and tries with even\n  greater fervor.

Yuri would have a\n            better chance of opening it\n            than you two faggots.\n  We see a quick shot of Yuri again. He is quiet and\n  wan. Barely present.\n  Mike the Shit snatches the bottle away and goes at it\n  with great difficulty.\n\n                                                     49.\n\n\n\nKENSINGTON, (gorgeous 30-something Amazonian\nbartender) is dressed in a sports HALTER TOP and\ntight SKIRT.

She\npours up the flutes and keeps walking.\nEveryone laughs except Mike the Shit.\nMike the Shit picks up his flute glass. The rest of the\nguys follow suit.

Go make\n          yourself a stiff drink until\n          the craving passes.\nHe hangs up and loudly bangs both phones on the bar\nlike setting his rifles down at the end of the day.\n                    JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n               Chewie!\nWe can see that Kensington loves his humor and equally\nloves to sass him back.\n                    JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n               (pointing to the TVs\n               above the bar playing\n               the news)\n          Turn that shit up!\n\n                                                      52.\n\n\n                    KENSINGTON\n               (while grabbing the\n               remote)\n               Fuck you, Joaquin.\nJoaquin looks towards the booth, impressed that she\njust said \u2019fuck you\u2019 to him.\nWe see the brokers in the booth laughing.\nHe extends his arms to their furthest length on the\nbar wood while still looking at the booth.\n                    JOAQUIN\n          I want this many shots! Make\n          them from the House of\n          Cognac..\nJoaquin is still looking at the booth, especially\nDante, eyes twinkling.\nKensington starts setting up SHOT GLASSES between his\nhands. His hands don\u2019t move.\nEveryone at the booth leans back, laughing.\n                    DUNAWAY\n          Herrrrrre comes The Joaquin\n          Show. Brace yourself Dante.\nThe group is laughing and nodding as they all nurse a\nshot.\n                    JOAQUIN\n          Hey... HEY! Make \u2019em tight as\n          your arse, Blanche.\nDante watches as Kensington fills every square inch of\nspace between his outstretched arms with shooters. We\nalso notice that she is pouring from the LOUIS XIII\nCRYSTAL BOTTLE, $10,000/bottle.\nMike Christian nods his head towards Mike the Shit.\n                    MIKE CHRISTIAN\n          Just be happy Mike\u2019s not\n          ordering the shots.\nMike the Shit gives him a long-armed punch from across the\ntable. To Dante:\n             MIKE CHRISTIAN (CONT\u2019D)\n          See what I mean?\n\n                                                       53.\n\n\nJoaquin lumbers over with 2 shots in each hand,\nfingers in the shot glasses and giant phones under his\narmpits. The humor in his walk is only exacerbated by\nthe bulky pager and beeper hanging off his belt loops.\n\nIn the b.g. Kensington is loading the rest of the\nshots; a double-decker tray.\n                    JOAQUIN\n          Holy shit, what a motley crew!\n          Make some room for some high\n          quality.\nHe seems to be referring to himself and his shooters\nas he pushes his way into the sardine booth, facing\nthe TVs. He passes Dante the two shots in his right\nhand. While licking the booze off his fat finger and\nthumb:\n                    JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n               (to Dante)\n          OHHHHHHH STATE! You look a fright!\n          (looks at her again)\n          So, how\u2019s it goin\u2019, Fancypants?\nHe looks over at Yuri, who has been quiet up to this\npoint. Joaquin flamboyantly jumps back in feigned fright.\n                    JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n          Jesus! You got a face on you\n          like a bag \u2019o smashed\n          assholes!

This man has a joke a second, not\nthat you can understand them.\n                    JOAQUIN\n          Holy shit. We better git some\n          medicine in ya.\nKensington arrives and places all the shots Joaquin just\nbought on the adjacent two-top.\n                    KENSINGTON\n          Startin\u2019 out slow, are we?\n\n                                                       54.\n\n\nJoaquin is beckoning to Kensington to bring him a couple\nof shots from his stash.\n                    JOAQUIN\n               (pointing at Kensington\n               and then Yuri)\n          Get me one for Yee, and one for Pee.\nThe group snickers. Joaquin hands it to Yuri and looks\nto Dante and Kensington for a cheers.\n\n\n                    JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n          Down the hatch.\nJoaquin gives a little look to the group, and they all\ngrab a shot from the table. The group shoots them\nback. Yuri, with a delay, shoots his back also.\n                    JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n          Holy shit, if I wanted to\n          have tea with the queen, I\n          woulda went to Buckingham\n          fucking palace. Come on, miss,\n          let\u2019s go.\nHe pushes her second shot towards her brashly. She\nhas a mini dry heave when she takes the shot and the\ngroup snickers. They all join her for a second shot.\nJoaquin just grabs a random from the table.\n                    JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n               (makes a face)\n          Gasoline!\nJoaquin is rubbing the chest hair spewing out of his\nopened dress shirt top, tie in his breast pocket. He\nseems to be studying her while continuing to rub his\nchest hair.\n                    JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n          So, who made you? Two mutts?\nDante has no idea what he is talking about, and it shows.\n                    MIKE CHRISTIAN\n          He means, who are your parents?\nJoaquin loves when someone understands what he is\nsaying. With a wink and a head jerk, to Mike C.:\n                    JOAQUIN\n          Spot on, buddy.\n\n                                                      55.\n\n\n                    MIKE CHRISTIAN\n          Don\u2019t worry, he doesn\u2019t always\n          talk like this. His Newfie\n          always comes out when he\n          drinks... or when it\u2019s\n          showtime.\n                 JOAQUIN\n       It\u2019s NEWFOUNDLANDER to you,\n         My son...\nThe group laughs. Joaquin looks back at Dante, awaiting\nher response.\n                    DANTE\n          My mom is Haitian, and my dad\n          is Puerto... wait, no...\n          other way around... ?\nDante is laughing. She is too drunk to remember her\nparents\u2019 heritage. Joaquin is shaking his head again.\n                    JOAQUIN\n          Holy shit, she\u2019s not gonna\n          last a minute. Maybe you need\n          a shot of PENIS-CILLIN?\nHe grabs his package (he likes to do this). The group\nis killing themselves laughing. Dante eyes seem to\nlinger a bit too long on him grabbing his package as\nshe attempts a quick testicle count.\n\n                    JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n          Ahhh, you like that? Well,\n          there is a lot more where\n          that came from.\nThe group is still laughing. He drops his package and\nlooks at the group as though he didn\u2019t just do\nanything raunchy.\n                    JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n          So, what\u2019s the word boys?\n                    MIKE THE SHIT\n          Well, Dante here has a secret\n          that Abe told her. She won\u2019t\n          divulge.\n                    JOAQUIN\n          No secrets here, Dante. Rule #1.\nLaynah walks up beside Joaquin. She has changed her\nshirt so that her fake boobs are bursting out the\nimpossibly small bodice she\u2019s stretched over them.\n\n                                                       56.\n\n\nShe has clearly re-done her make-up, hair, and outfit.\nShe is smiling through her fire engine red lipstick --\nwhich is all over her front teeth.\n\n                    LAYNAH\n          What\u2019s going on, boys?\nAs we see Dante take a sigh of relief, Joaquin turns\nhis head right into her cleavage.\n                    JOAQUIN\n          Holy shit! Ma? Ma? Is that you, MA?\n\nHe is nose deep into her cleavage and is grabbing at\nher breasts, as though trying to recognize them. She\nslaps his hands away.\n                    LAYNAH\n          Screw you, Joaquin. Move over.\nShe barely fits herself at the end of the booth.\nDante looks to her and rubs her front teeth as though\nto tell her there is lipstick on her teeth -- girl\ncode, and as an olive branch. She\u2019s needs someone on\nher side here.\nLaynah, as usual, doesn\u2019t understand, and pretends to\nrub her front teeth right back, as though mocking\nDante\u2019s actions. Although, she doesn\u2019t quite touch\nher teeth, so they stay stained.\nJoaquin leans over to Dante and whispers. Well,\nok, he speaks loud enough for everyone to hear.\n                    JOAQUIN\n          Stunned as mi arse.\nLaynah hits Joaquin. He laughs.\nCassandra walks through the \u2019saloon doors\u2019, just\nhanging up her phone. This seems to be a much looser\nCassandra than Dante from earlier as she is, yes,\ndancing her way towards the bar. She is quite drunk.\nShe stops short of the bar and throws her arms up.\n                    CASSANDRA\n          This night\u2019s on MEEEEE! WE GOT\n          CANE DEEDS!\nShe is pointing towards Yuri.\n\n                                                       57.\n\n\n                    CASSANDRA\n          That\u2019s right my friend, we did it!\nYuri smiles and gives another thumbs up. It looks like\nhe has been up for days to help close this deal. We see\nthe guys around him congratulating him.\n                    CASSANDRA (CONT\u2019D)\n          Your best tequila all around,\n          Kensy!\n               (beat, pointing to the\n          TVs) Turn that shit down, and\n          the music UP!\nWe see Kensington turning down the TVs and turning up the\nstereo. We notice that she has turned on the TV subtitles.\n\n\nThe group starts clapping and whooping.\n                     JOAQUIN\n               (leaning into Dante)\n          Don\u2019t think we are done with you.\nHe puts his hand on her leg and holds it there a bit\ntoo long.\nAs Cassandra dances over, we see everyone reaching for\na shot for cheers.\nThe music is loud, and the party has officially\nstarted. CLINK!\n\nGEMINI\u2019S PRIVATE VIP ROOM - LATER\n\nThere is loud club music (something like Gypsy Kings\n- Bamboleo) and flashes of VERY DRUNK QUICK CLIPS\nbetween black transitions. We hear some dialogue here\nand there. Things like, \u2019you wanna see the real\nthing?\u2019 when she is caught looking at someone\u2019s\npackage. \u2019What\u2019s the secret?\u2019 \u2019What did Abe tell\nyou?\u2019 \u2019DANTE! WHAT IS THE FUCKING SECRET?!\u2019\nHere we also see Paul and SMITH who is the co-owner of\nthe bar, and twin brother of Kensington. He is in his\nearly 30s, handsome (almost pretty), and sweet\nlooking. Kensington introduces him to Dante. Dunaway\nand Smith are laughing together.\n\n                                                    58.\n\n\nCassandra is on the bar table singing, Dante and\nothers are dancing, shooters are being tipped back,\nthere is lots of drinking, lots of drugs, blow off\nhookers, gambling at the tables, men reaching for\ntheir giant money wads, brokers making out with\nwomen, Laynah giving a blowjob to a broker in a\nbooth, and some have their arms around each other and\nare singing loudly. We really see the brotherhood,\nmen demeaning women, and the excessiveness in this\nscene.\n\nEveryone, including Dante, seems to be having the time\nof their life.\nWe also see scenes of Cassandra telling her to\n\u2019straighten up/hold yourself together\u2019 while snorting\ncoke from her giant, SILVER RING.\n\n                     END OF ACT THREE\n\n                                                       59.\n\n\n                        ACT FOUR\n\nINT. PRIVATE VIP ROOM - LATER\n\nDante looks quite green. She is swaying and her eyes\nlook like they are blinking independently of each\nother. She is sweating and her make-up is running down\nher face.\nJoaquin notices her state, grabs her, and quickly ushers\nher into the men\u2019s washroom.\n\nINT. GEMINIS - MEN\u2019S WASHROOM\nAs they enter, we see PAUL, in front of the urinal,\njust zipping up his pants under his giant gut. He\nlooks from Joaquin to Dante to Joaquin\u2019s \u2019get the fuck\nout of here\u2019 face.\nHe exits very quickly without a word.\nSHUNNNNNNNNNNNP. Joaquin drags the GARBAGE CAN in\nfront of the door.\nHe reaches into his pocket and takes out a rather\nLARGE BAG of WHITE POWDER and a STRAW. He proceeds to\ncreate a line on the side of the sink with his one of\nhis BLACK VISA CREDIT CARDS (we see him choosing).\n                   JOAQUIN\n          You need to straighten up.\n                (passing her the straw)\n          Here.\nDante has never done drugs in her life. Drinking,\nyes. Drugs, no.\nShe is drunk. She is disinhibited. She grabs the straw\nand shakily places it at the start of the line. We hear a\nbig SNIIIIIFFFFFFFF as the white powder slowly\ndisappears.\nAs Dante\u2019s head comes up, we see that she has a fair\namount under her nose, and she is choking.\n                  DANTE\n          It musta went down the wrong tube--\nJoaquin face reflects his disdain, and he hands\nher his pocket napkin.\n\n                                                       60.\n\n\n                  JOAQUIN\n          -- Jesus. Wipe that shit up\n          newbie before someone licks\n          it from yer nose. This is\n          some velvety shit. Don\u2019t\n          waste it.\n\nHe takes a small, what looks like a BRASS LOCKET, out\nof his other pocket. There is a small, BRASS STRAW on\ntop. He takes a different baggie of white powder out\nof the other pocket and makes a fat line.\nAs his head comes up, we see his face and eyes are\nblazing red. He is a whole different, and scarier,\nperson than earlier.\n                 JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n          Enough\u2019s enough. I\u2019m giving\n          you 3 choices: you either\n          tell me Abe\u2019s secret, I fire\n          you... or (beat) you blow me.\n          Right now, Spic.\nDante wildly stares at Joaquin.\nAfter a long beat, she walks towards him slowly,\nseductively. As she approaches, she lays her hand on\nhis giant gut. He looks at her, sweating like a pig.\nHer hand slowly trails down his King Henry VIII mound,\ntowards his groin. She undoes his zipper. Her hand\nslips in. He is smiling and his head tilts back.\nShe grabs his testicles hard. So much so that we see\nhis body slightly raise on the wall. He is wincing in\npain. All men watching the show should be saying,\nMama, along with him.\n                  DANTE\n               (whispering into his ear)\n          Do you want to keep both of\n          these, or shall I bring one\n          to Abe, as bounty, and create\n          my own destiny?\nJoaquin is shaking his head yes, then no, then...\nwhatever he is trying to convey, it clearly means, LET\nGO. She lets go of his testicles and we see him\nslightly drop to the floor. Lower than before as he\nis hunching in pain and somewhat winded.\n                  JOAQUIN\n               (breathlessly)\n          Bitch.\n\n                                                    61.\n\n\nDante exits the washroom.\n\n\nINT. GEMINI\u2019S BAR - 8:45PM - CONTINUOUS\nDante is coming out of the bathroom, sweating.\nXander walks straight up beside her, sipping a CLEAR\nDRINK with a bobbing LIME. He says nothing to her, as\nthey watch the drunk insanity in front of them,\ntogether.\nDante looks to him and sees that he is watching Dunaway\ntuck into a SALAD. Her eyes follow to Dunaway eating.\n                  XANDER\n          You know, ever since Dunaway\n          had the testicular cancer,\n          he\u2019s become a real pain in\n          the ass health nut.\n               (beat)\n          He\u2019s even doing yoga.\nXander hands her his drink.\n                  XANDER (CONT\u2019D)\n          Here, water. You have to balance\n          this.\nDante gratefully takes the water and downs it.\n\n                  XANDER (CONT\u2019D)\n          Have you even eaten today?\nBefore she can respond, Joaquin storms out of the\nwashroom, red faced, sweaty, and freshly coked up. He\nis walking a bit funny.\n                 DANTE\n               (to self)\n          Uh-oh...\n\n                 JOAQUIN\n               (enraged and shouting)\n          I think it\u2019s time that our\n          new little piggy takes herself\n          alllllll the way home.\nJoaquin is at the bar exit pointing at Dante and\nmotioning her towards the door. He is adjusting\nhimself in his pants.\nThe crowd that is close enough to hear starts\n\n                                                      62.\n\n\nlaughing and oinking, before going back to their\nshenanigans. Dante looks around and no one seems to\nbe helping her except Xander, who cocks his head\ntowards the door.\n                       XANDER\n            Go.\nDante exits quickly.\n\nEXT. SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF TAXI\nJoaquin is behind Dante, marching her out. He\nimmediately waves a CAB down and opens a door for\nher.\n                       JOAQUIN\n            Get in.\nAs Dante heads towards the cab, we see that walking has\nsuddenly become very difficult. He grabs her arm and\nroughly sits her in the cab, closes the door and walks\naround to the CABBIE\u2019S window. He pulls his THICK MONEY\nCLIP out, full of HUNDREDS.\n                      JOAQUIN (CONT\u2019D)\n            Take this ditch pig home.\nThe cabbie (ARMAN) is a well-manicured, AFGHAN MALE in\nhis 40s. Joaquin slips the cabbie $100.\n                      ARMAN\n                 (with a Farsi\n            accent) Yes, sir.\nArman starts asking Dante where to go, we see Joaquin\nmoving back around the cab with a strange smile slowly\ncurling across his face.\nHe pats the back of the cab a couple of times to send\nit off.\nBAM! BAM!\n\nINT. CAB - 9PM - CONTINUOUS\nFade in from black. It is quiet. Only the motor of the\ncab is heard.\nWe see Dante wilting in the back, head in hands.\n\n                                                    63.\n\n\n                    DANTE\n               (to self)\n          Fuck. Fuck. Fucka. Fucka.\n          Fucka. Fuck.\nDante slumps against the cab window, eyes glassy.

APARTMENT BUILDING, CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF APT.\nDOOR. - JUST PAST 9PM\nDante is in front of an apartment door rustling for her\nKEYS in her purse. She pulls the keys back and looks\nat all of them. She notices a new KEY CHAIN. It is\ntwo, golden testicles with a mini plaque saying \u2019He\nWho Owns the Gold Rules\u2019. She has a brief memory of\nAbe giving her these telling her she \u2019needs a pair\u2019.\nDante looks up to take the moment in and smiles.\nWhen she finally finds her key, she keeps trying the\nlock and missing while longer transition scenes of\nblack are occurring.\nWhen she finally gets the key part of the way in, it\ndoesn\u2019t seem to fit.\nFade to black.\n\nWe hear a \u2019bang\u2019 and a \u2019thump\u2019 in the\ndark... FADE IN\nDante is lying on her side with her eyes wide open.\nOne eye is quickly swelling. She is looking upward.
