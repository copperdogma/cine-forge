          "PILOT - INTO THE FIRE"

    INSIPRED BY REAL PEOPLE, REAL EVENTS

                        TEASER
A BLACK SCREEN—
Sounds of a man and woman arguing in Puerto Rican
Spanish are peppered with those of tumbling furniture
and shattering glass.
FADE IN

INT. DINGY MOTEL ROOM - LATE DAY
A SMALL FIGURE quickly scampers to a CHAIR in a corner
of the room. We continue to hear yelling and things
being thrown around the room.
The light from the setting sun is coming through the
MOTEL room WINDOW and hits the face of the small
figure. We see YOUNG DANTE with dark hair and big
brown, frightened eyes.
SMACK--

The little girl sees DANTE’S MOTHER (30s, Latina,
fragile yet tough) head hit the floor in front of her.
Her mother is lying on her side with her eyes wide
open and looking up at the little girl. A trickle of
blood starts trailing down her jawline from her ear.
Her eyes are scared yet attempting reassurance.
The little girl appears frozen in a trance as she looks
down on her mother.

                  YOUNG DANTE
          Uno... Dos... Tres...
The sun illuminates behind DANTE’S FATHER (30s,
Haitian, large and scary) as his shadowy figure looks
up to the little girl. He puts a finger to his lips
and walks out.
CUT TO BLACK
--we hear the little girl’s voice morph into the voice
of a woman counting in a whisper in her head.

                                                       2.



                   DANTE (V.O., CONT’D)
           ... Quatro... Cinco... Seis...
FADE IN:

INT. BEL INC. OFFICE, WINTER, 1997 - JUST BEFORE DAWN
We see a man’s lower jaw and mouth moving while talking.
The counting appears to be for the man’s teeth.
                     DANTE (V.O., CONT’D)
           ... Siete... Ocho... Nueve...
We are looking at the patterns of a woman’s dress.
Then, to a woman’s mouth moving. No sound, until...
                     CASSANDRA
            ... Dante?
CASSANDRA (late-30s woman, well-put together and
stern). She has a borderline English accent, but
she was born and raised here, in Manhattan.
                        DANTE (V.O.)
           Yes. Ummm…
                     JOAQUIN
           You havin’ a seizure? You
           wanna borrow Cassandra’s ball
           gag so you don’t swallow your
           tongue?
JOAQUIN is a chubby, short, half-bald with a burnt
hair comb-over male in his 50s). His mother is a
Newfoundlander, and he often uses the accent when
cracking jokes, which is most of the time.
A third set of eyes is looking at the woman. This is
ABE, a chronically tired, highly manicured ’silver
fox’ in his 50s.
They are all affluently dressed and in 3 expensive leather
office chairs.
Across from these 3 figures is DANTE (mid-late 20s
stunning woman with milk chocolate skin).

                                                    3.



The room is slightly dark in these last moments before
dawn. There is nothing else in the room but a window and
a FIERY PAINTING worth more than most people’s homes,
behind the interviewers.
Without breaking his eye-contact with Dante, Abe raises
one ’enough’ finger to Joaquin.
                    ABE
          I will repeat the question
          this once. If you ran over
          someone on your way to work,
          would you stop, or would you
          keep going?
                    DANTE
          I would keep going.
                    JOAQUIN
          You got human fucking blood
          all over your grill. You keep
          going?
                    DANTE
          No. I would stop first. I
          would see how they are.
Dante’s eyes dart frantically to all the interviewers.
                    ABE
          And if stopping would cause
          you to miss the market
          opening in London...?
                    JOAQUIN
          You just whammed someone, and
          you’re shitfaced. You think
          it’s wise to stop?
                    DANTE
          Well, no, not if I was going
          to be late. I would keep
          going if I was going to be
          late...
               (beat; confused)
          I’m on my way to work?
                     JOAQUIN
          Exactly.
Joaquin sits back. All is quiet and all 3 are staring
at Dante.

                                                    4.


                  CASSANDRA
          Dante. Honey. Why exactly do
          you want to work for BEL? Be
          honest.
A beat between Cassandra and Dante. Dante takes a
large breath and refocuses. Somewhat practiced…

                  DANTE
          Because I want to be rich. I
          want to be powerful.
               (beat)
          Because I want to be somebody
          that nobody can fuck with.
Silence. The 3 interviewers are staring at her.
Cassandra and Joaquin smile. Abe remains stone-faced.
The sun begins to rise, and the dawn light pours
in, illuminating Dante’s face.

                        ACT ONE

INT. BEL INC. EMPTY WASHROOM - EARLY MORNING

Marble everything. Gold fixtures gleam under soft lighting.
As we FADE IN, we hear excited squealing.
                    DANTE (into phone)
            I got it!

  She is speaking excitedly in non-sequiturs.

               DANTE (CONT’D)
            I only have a minute ’cause
            I’m about to have a tour
            around my new office. Ahh!
            I’ve never been so happy!
            Carajo... what a grueling
            process. This one was nothing
            like the other two. It was
            just... weird. I... I can’t
            believe I got it after
            that... I just need these
            next two years... Ah! I’m
            calling you on my new
            CELLPHONE!
  Dante is awkwardly holding a brand-new giant MOTOROLA.
  She is smiling and brimming over with joy.


               DANTE (CONT’D)
                 (into phone)
            Yah, I tried to do what you
            said, but I was so
            nervous... I just blanked--
                 (beat)
            You know, it seemed like
            Cassandra had the final say.
            She’s the one who pulled me
            aside after the interview to
            tell me I was hired --
  Dante is listening intently.
               DANTE (CONT’D)
                 (into phone)
            -- oh yah, Abe. Yah, I
            finally met him.
                 (laughs and whispers)
            He is a pencil-necked prick--

                                                    6.


Dante’s sentence is interrupted by a woman walking into
the bathroom. It is LAYNAH, a 30-something broad-
shouldered, fake-breasted broker dressed in high-end
country club wear.

                    DANTE
         Hi
Laynah looks her up and down and shoots her a murderous
glare while heading to a stall.
She turns her back and covers the phone receiver with
her hand. She resumes listening.

                  DANTE
               (whispering into phone)
          I don’t know.
          (beat)
          In the office bathroom.
          (beat)
Dante looks up to a small mirror mounted in the top corner
of the bathroom. (*Note: We won’t know this until later,
but this is a camera that Abe and Joaquin watch
regularly.)
                     DANTE
                  (whispers)
          Fuck.

She hears a muffled sniff coming from the stall at the
same time the toilet flushes.

Dante turns to the mirror and looks at herself in full.
Over it, PRELAP:

                  LAYNAH (V.O.)
          Who the HELL is that
          Dominican street trash?

INT. ABE’S OFFICE - MORNING
We see Laynah, jaw grinding and enraged.
Abe is at his desk reading documents and listening to a
constant stream of news radio through an EAR BUD. He
doesn’t look up.

                                                       7.


Adorning the wall behind him is a giant PAINTING of a
storming ocean. His desk is sprawling and elegant with
DOCUMENTS and NEWSPAPERS neatly stacked in various
piles. We see his PAGER and BEEPER side by side at the
corner of the desk. The office is stunning, pristine,
and nothing short of regal.
                   LAYNAH (CONT’D)
          I thought we had a freeze on
          hiring more women. Something
          about ’bleeding, cramps and
          no more mat leave’?
Abe’s phone starts to ring. It is at his ear before the
ring ends.

                    GRETA (V.O.)
          Dunaway needs your help with
          Mr. Daniels, sir.
Abe knows exactly what this means. Without looking at
her, he puts his finger up to Laynah, and points to
the small, leather LOVE SEAT at the back of the room.
                    ABE
               (into phone)
          Count to 30 and connect me.
Abe cradles the phone and presses ’hold’.
We see Laynah sit down in a huff, drumming her false
nails on the fine leather.
Abe jumps up and runs to the corner of his office
where we see a PUNCHING BAG. He intensely pounds off
a few rounds.
On his way back, he turns the STEREO on and cranks
the volume. It is the frenzied sound of brokers. He
goes to the phone and answers completely out of
breath with voice racing. He starts pacing.
                   ABE (CONT’D)
            (panting into phone)
           Steven! Steve...
Abe is listening impatiently. STEVEN DANIELS is a
long-time client of Abe’s. Always second-guessing and
backing out of deals, he needs a LOT of reassurance.
Abe knows exactly how to play him.

                                                        8.


                    ABE (CONT’D)
               (yelling into phone)
          Yes. Yes. I understand. You
          need to calm down Steve.
          Listen, the London numbers are
          out, and the market is
          tanking. The employment
          numbers came out (panting)…
          they are weak, and they are
          low. Now prices are getting
          jacked up because the storm
          and power outages have been
          pooling energy over. EVERYONE
          is shorting their stock. All
          my brokers are here early to
          clean this fucking mess up.
          We need to get everyone’s
          tickets in the second the
          market opens.
               (holds phone to stereo)
We hear the frantic, muffled voice of Steven Daniels on
the other line. Abe brings the phone back to his ear.
We notice a practiced cadence to Abe’s speech.
                    ABE (CONT’D)
               (into phone)
          Steve, the longer you hold on
          to the position the worse it
          will be. Hold on. Let me go
          to my desk and get out of
          this frenzy.
                (slowly turns down volume)
          Listen. You either get rid of
          those shares now, or they
          will be as worthless as a used
          fucking condom. Are you
          listening to me? No one will
          want to buy them. Do you
          enjoy high quality toilet
          paper, Daniels? Do you? Tell
          me. Because if you do, these
          shares are about to become
          the most expensive shit
          tickets you have ever owned.
          Hell, if you like them so
          much, we can get you more and
          give your ass      the   royal
          treatment it deserves!
Laynah muffles a laugh. Abe’s eyes flicker up to her.
She quickly wipes the smile off her face. We hear
Daniels’ muffled rambling again.

                                                    9.


Abe sits back down at his desk and reaches for a
BLANK TICKET while listening.
             ABE (CONT’D)
               (into phone)
          Steven, you sound like you
          need some relax time. Listen,
          I’ll dump your shares, and
          then we’ll all go out for a
          nice night on the town
          tomorrow to celebrate. We’ll
          end up at Flashdancers--
He looks back up to Laynah.
             ABE (CONT’D)
               (into phone)
          -- in fact, why don’t I have
          one of my girls pick you up
          an hour before...
Laynah is pleading ’no’ with her eyes. He doesn’t
react to her.
             ABE (CONT’D)
               (into phone)
          ... to help you wind down.
               (beat)
          Excellent. Done deal. 7pm,
          tomorrow. We’ll start at
          I’Tremeli. I’ll have our
          people let the banks know the
          second the market opens.
          You made the right call
          Steven. See you then.
As Abe hangs up, he starts writing the ticket. A
painfully long silence occurs in the room.
                  ABE
          First, although it is none of
          your business, she is not
          hired. When have we ever
          hired at the 3rd interview?
                    LAYNAH
          We haven’t --
                    ABE
          -- Yes. We haven’t. Ever.
          Lastly, 6pm tomorrow, be at
          Steven Daniels’ house. Look
          slutty –
               (MORE)

                                                       10.


                    ABE (CONT’D)
               (looks up and re-considers)
               -- er.
          And don’t wear one of your
          JAP-y Bar Mitzvah dresses.
Laynah gets up to leave.

                    ABE (CONT’D)
          Oh, and tell Greta to make
          the reso. And take this
          ticket to Crooked Tits.
As Abe is giving Laynah the ticket, we see, through
the slightly ajar door, the back of Dante and a very
curvy blonde woman stopped in front.
Dante turns and looks at Abe. There is a beat
between them. Abe looks back down to his
business at hand.

INT. 3RD FLOOR CORRIDOR – MORNING - CONTINUOUS
GRETA (GREATNESS), 40s, the office manager (but more
like office mother), and her sweet perma-smile, are
touring Dante around the building. She has a wholesome
beauty about her. In her sing-song voice:
                    GRETA
               (pointing to the bottom
               floor)
          Now, Abe has 2 offices--
BAM! Laynah collides with Dante’s back.


                    DANTE
          Oops! Sorry...
As Dante turns, her and Laynah have a beat between them.
                    GRETA
          Oh, wonderful timing! I was
          just touring around our
          newest broker-in-training,
          Dante...
          (looking to Dante)
          De La Cruz?
               (Dante nods)
          This is Laynah. She
          is a wonderfully
          motivated and--

                                                       11.


Laynah’s scowl has turned into a large, fake and
tight smile. She postures for Dante. Her voice is
irritating.

                    LAYNAH
               (overlapping her)
          --we met in the washroom.
          Didn’t we? You were talking
          on the phone.
               (tight smile)
          Well, I’m very busy.
               (holding up the
               ticket)
          Welcome to the family... Dante.
Laynah turns on her heel and leaves.
                    DANTE
          Thank you. Nice to
          meet--
                    LAYNAH
               (overlapping)
          --oh, and Greta...
          (Laynah turns back)
          ... Abe wants to take me out
          for dinner tomorrow night,
          with Mr. Daniels, to thank me
          for helping save his account.
          Make reservations for 3 at
          I’Tremeli. 7pm.
Laynah quickly rushes off.
Greta smiles sweetly at Dante and puts her arm in hers.

                  GRETA
          Well, Cassandra has requested
          that I set you up in your new
          home before the market opens,
          so, let’s get this tour
          going, shall we?
Dante looks back at Abe. His back is now turned to
her, and he is on the phone.
                  GRETA (CONT’D)
          Speaking of whom, guess who
          is next?
Greta ushers her forward. Cassandra is on the phone.

                                                       12.


                    GRETA (CONT’D)
          Oopsie! It’s best not to
          disturb her right now.
They walk past an art-deco white DESK with fine
lines. The area is impeccably clean and minimalistic.
Any office necessity that you do see is made of clean
steel, glass, or is white. Even the TELEVISION is
beautiful.
Cassandra is at this desk, on her COMPUTER, on her
PHONE, watching the morning news, checking her
PAGER and half-watching the transaction that just
occurred.
                    CASSANDRA
               (firmly into the phone)
          I said, I will handle it.
          This one is mine. Trust me.
We hear Abe in the adjacent office hanging up his
phone a moment before Cassandra.
Prelap:
We hear loud whirring and the sound of dial up internet.


INT. CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF I.T. DESKS - MORNING
Greta and Dante are standing in front of 2
incredibly messy desks in a room full of half-
repaired COMPUTERS, SYSTEM UNITS, PRINTERS,
SCREENS, CORDS, WIRES -- I.T.
heaven.
                    GRETA
          Here we have some of our
          hardest workers. Our I.T.
          gentleman are here from dusk
          ’til dawn. If you have any
          technical questions, these
          are the brilliant minds to
          ask.
She raises her voice towards the men.
                    GRETA (CONT’D)
          Gentleman, this is Dante.
Dante nods in hello at what appears to be the stocky
guy (JOHN) and the lanky guy (TENNESSEE). Both look
like they haven’t seen the light of day for years.

                                                       13.


Tennessee looks up from one of the desks quickly and
skittishly looks away while typing. John looks up from
his desk, lingers, and winks. He has 4 opened SAUCES
in front of him and is eating an EGG MCMUFFIN. The
sauce is all over his chin and shirt.
Greta beams at them.
                    GRETA (CONT’D)
          That is Tennessee...
          ... and John.
                    DANTE
          Nice to meet you both.
                    JOHN
               (lewdly sucking the
               sauce off his Mc Muffin)
          Hi Dante. Thor.
               (motions to himself)
As they continue around the square of the corridor,
Dante looks down towards the center of the office.
This is the pit. It is where all the brokers and
board people work. It is full of TV SCREENS, PHONES,
and large PC COMPUTERS appended on top of large
pillars. The massive CLOCK in the middle of the room
has NYC written on top and reads 8:30am. The office
has been relatively quiet up until now, save for a few
brokers reading the Wall Street Journal quietly at
their desks, as other employees start to file in for
the day.
Greta starts quickly pointing out who is who to Dante.
                    GRETA
          Ah, here come some of the
          brokers. That is Dunaway,
          Mike, Paul... another Mike...

MIKE THE SHIT, (tall, 30-something broker with a
temper), and PAUL ‘BIG WILLIE’, (humpty-dumpty man
in his 50s), are snorting laughing. They seem drunk.
They look up to see the two ladies. Mike bends Paul
over the desk and pretends to butt fuck him. They
switch and Paul pretends to butt fuck Mike. When
they are finished, they start stretching as though
just waking up.
                    MIKE THE SHIT
               (loudly)
          Ahhhh... thanks buddy. Ready
          for the day.

                                                      14.


They high five each other and head to their desks,
acting like it is just normal routine.
                    GRETA
               (laughing)
          Those two are such hams!
          Don’t pay any mind to them
          Dante, they just love to make
          us laugh. You’ll be sitting
          just above Mike actually.
There is more filing in, but Greta keeps walking
towards the stairway to the trading pit.
Dante is visibly nervous. Greta softly, yet firmly,
puts a hand on Dante’s arm.
                    GRETA (CONT’D)
          Yes... you’ll be starting out
          right down there.
               (pointing to the floor
               just above Mike, who is
               now downing a bottle of
               PEPTO BISMAL)
          Dunaway will help you get
          started for the first month
          or so and --
Cassandra walks up and interrupts Greta’s tour.
                    CASSANDRA
          -- Pardon me for interrupting
          Greta. May I steal Dante
          away?
Greta is always accommodating.

                    GRETA
          Of course, Cassandra. We can
          finish our tour later.
               (turning to Dante and
               taking her hands)
         You come and see me if you
         need anything. Ok? I mean
         that. Anything at all, I am
         here for you.
Greta gives Dante a huge hug and hands her coat back to her.

                    DANTE
          Thank you, Greta. You are so kind.

                                                      15.


Greta nods and then walks down the stairs towards the
pit. A few of the guys yell out "GREATNESSSSSS!". She is
smiling at them and saying her good mornings.

                    CASSANDRA
          I thought that maybe you and
          I could get a little
          breakfast. Are you peckish?

                     DANTE
          Yes, I am.
               (beat)
          Is it ok... for me to just go?
                    CASSANDRA
          Everything is always okay
          when you are with me.
          Besides, the market is going
          to be dead for a while. Did
          you get your office phone?
Dante digs in her cheap PURSE and presents her new
Motorola phone that Greta gave her earlier. We note
Cassandra looking at her purse with disgust.
They smile at each other.
                    CASSANDRA
          Wonderful. Be sure to have it
          on you at all times. We can
          head out this way.

They head to the top floor and toward
the elevator.

                   CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
         (yelling to the board person
             just arriving)
         Make sure you page any calls
         from Cane straight to my cell
         phone. No ifs, ands, or buts.
              (beat)
         And keep that JAP bitch off
         my clients!
Cassandra places a KEY in a brass wall panel of the
elevator and turns it. The elevator ’dings’ with the same
sound as a cash register.

                                                    16.



                    CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
               (slightly embarrassed)
          Joaquin.
The elevator doors open and it is stunning and
ornate. The music is Baroque opera. Other than
mirrors on all walls, it resembles the Sistine
Chapel. Dante’s face reflects her awe.
Cassandra has a small look of satisfaction on her
face as she presses ’G’. We see on the panel that one
of the floors has KEY ACCESS only.
We hear the ’cash register ding’ again as we
watch the thick, embossed brass elevator doors
close.

INT. GEMINI’S BAR - 8:35AM - CONTINUOUS
The doors open into a quiet, empty and low-lit bar. It
is full of deep mahogany wood and plush, red leather
BOOTHS. We see that the front door is closed, and the
window shades are drawn. It is clearly before opening
hours, yet a lone bartender looks up in greeting.
EMMA, (plain woman in her 20s), smiles at them and
immediately grabs a REMOTE CONTROL to turn on the
music (hyper-beat French Techno), and all the TVs. The
TVs are all set to various news channels. She takes
everything down to a low volume. Emma does anything
the brokers tell her to as they take care of her very
well.
They take a seat at the wood, and the Emma is over
immediately. Cassandra places her pager and beeper
beside her hand and checks it periodically when Dante
is speaking.
                    CASSANDRA
               (to Dante)
          Would you like a
               juice?
               (to Emma)
          Two breakfast juices
               Emma.
               (to Dante)
          I apologize for how stressful
          those interviews can be. It’s
          nice to be able to talk with
          you in a more relaxed
          atmosphere. How are you
          feeling thus far?

                                                       17.


                    DANTE
          Good. Very good.


                    CASSANDRA
          You look petrified Dante.
          Don’t lie to me. Are you
          scared?
                    DANTE
           No, no. I’m very excited.
Their ’breakfast juices’ arrive and Cassandra
immediately takes out a perfectly folded, CLOTH
NAPKIN from her purse, wipes the rim, and shoots hers
back. Dante is watching and follows suit almost
spitting it out as is it basically orange-tinted
pure alcohol.
                    DANTE (CONT’D)
               (small choke)
          I am very grateful to be
          working for this company. It
          was really nice of you to
          vouch --
While gazing at Dante, Cassandra takes 2 fingers and
taps the bar, much akin to "hit me" in ’21’.
                    CASSANDRA
               (over)
          --listen, Dante. You should
          be scared if your plan is to
          make it alone. You had but a
          glimpse of the boy’s club up
          there. It is ferocious and
          chauvinistic to the extreme.
          Those men are skin hungry pigs.
          (beat while looking at Dante)
          I am going to help you.
The next 2 breakfast juices arrive. Cassandra wipes the
rim again and shoots her drink. Dante follows suit. She
is eying Dante up and down.
                    CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
          First off, throw out that
          ridiculous perfume you are
          wearing. It’s fake, déclassé,
          and it stunk up the entire
          office. Even the stench of
          Laynah’s twat rot can’t
          (MORE)

                                                       18.




             CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
          overpower that crap. Second,
          you need new hair. Right now,
          it looks like a nest with a
          rat’s tail sewn into it.
          Your make-up... did Tammy Faye
          Bakker come out with a new
          J.C. Penny line? Do me a
          favor and don’t show up in
          your fucking Mexican prom
          dress tomorrow. And we need
          to work on your poker face …
          Do you need to fart?

Dante strained smile appears stuck in position.
             CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
          Now, I have been looking for
          a strong, intelligent,
          attractive woman to join
          forces with...
Cassandra looks Dante up and down. She taps the bar
again with 2 fingers with her eyes steady on Dante,
assessing.
             CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
          ... and this company is
          suffering from great
          deficiencies in that
          department.
               (beat)
          But I think you are moldable.
Dante looks scared and uneasy. Cassandra is watching the
bartender approach.
             CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
          I need you to cut this scared
          little girl shit and pull it
          together.
               (beat)
          You were hired because I have
          a good feeling about you,
          Dante. I need you to trust me
          and do what I say. Always. Do
          exactly what I say.
Two more breakfast juices arrive. Cassandra taps the
bar again with 2 fingers and makes a ’cut off’ line
with her index finger.

                                                      19.


                 DANTE
         Should we get some menus?
The bartender laughs quietly to herself and walks
away. Cassandra wipes the rim, shoots her drink, as
does Dante again. Cassandra maintains her composure as
though she’s had nothing to drink. Dante is already
beginning to show her state.
                  CASSANDRA
          Food contaminates the mind.
          Now... I have a friend on 5th
          Avenue who can get you
          started. Let’s consider this a
          welcome gift. From me to you.
Dante has no idea what she is talking about. Two more
drinks arrive. The bartender walks off. Cassandra wipes
the rim and turns to Dante. She holds up her drink with
a smile.


                    CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
          Your face Dante, relax your
          face. To the start of a
          stinking rich partnership.
Before Dante can respond, Cassandra has shot her
drink, stood up and is turning to leave.
Dante drinks and watches Cassandra walking away.
Cassandra turns and slaps the top of her hip once.
With that, Dante scrambles up from her seat and
heads towards Cassandra.

The somewhat blurry Emma is helping a couple of new
arrivals that she recognizes from the trading floor.
Emma looks up, smiles and waves, and starts making her
way around the bar. She gestures to encourage Dante to
leave with Cassandra quickly. Dante smiles and turns
to exit.
THUD! The door shuts in her face.

EXT. GEMINI’S BAR – STREET - CONTINUOUS
Cassandra is on her cell phone and hailing a cab
outside, not looking back for Dante. It is cold and
gray.

                                                     20.


The exterior bar door opens, and Dante is scurrying
towards her. Dante quickly notices that she forgot her
coat on the bar stool and quickly turns back to grab
her coat...

THUD! CLICK! The door closes and locks behind her. As
she goes to knock, she hears Cassandra slap the side
of the cab loudly. Dante turns and hurries towards the
CAB.

                      END OF ACT ONE

                                                       21.


                        ACT TWO

EXT. SAK’S FIFTH AVE - MORNING
A yellow taxi pulls up in front of Sak’s Fifth Ave.
Cassandra and Dante step out of the cab. Cassandra is
on the phone, and Dante looks like a kid in a candy
store.
Cassandra hangs up her phone call as they head towards
the front door.

EXT. SAK’S FIFTH AVE FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
The Saks Fifth Avenue sales manager smiling in greeting.
LILIANE, (slight, 60-something, exquisitely coiffed
female), is from the pre-plastic surgery generation
and wears her age gracefully. She is gracious, kind
and accommodating to her rich clients. She looks
Dante up and down and smiles quaintly.
                    LILIANE
          I trust this visit is for
          your new friend, Cassandra?
Cassandra smiles. Liliane unlocks and opens the door.

                    LILIANE (CONT’D)
          After you, ladies.
Cassandra slips in quickly. As Dante walks in, she
attempts to cover her awe. Liliane locks the door
again behind them.
                    CASSANDRA
          Liliane, this is Dante. Dante
          is a new broker at the firm.
          Please have her appearance
          reflect this.
Cassandra passes Liliane her BLACK VISA CARD. Dante
looks from Cassandra to Liliane with bewilderment.
                    LILIANE
          Of course, Ms. Constantine.
          It will be my absolute
          pleasure.
While dialing the phone, Cassandra pauses to look up
at Dante.

                                                       22.


                   CASSANDRA
            Have fun.
Liliane takes Dante’s arm in hers and leads her down
the hall. They stop at a wall near the front entrance
and Liliane opens a steel box with a key from her
GIANT KEY RING. She flicks on the light switches
inside. The entire store illuminates further and they
enter the adjacent elevator.
Much like the shopping scenes in Pretty Women, there
are various montages of Liliane dressing Cassandra in
beautiful CLOTHING, SHOES, MAKE-UP, and even attempts
to re-style Dante’s hair.
Cassandra is there, on the phone the entire time,
approving or disapproving everything. All that she
approves would be considered incredibly provocative.
Dante comes out with her final make-over and truly
looks like a high-end prostitute.
                  CASSANDRA
          Client entertaining outfit.
          Memorize this.
               (into phone)
          Fucktard, I told you to not
          let that JAP bitch talk to
          Cane.
Dante comes out with a provocative yet conservative
outfit.
             CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
          Office-wear. You can keep
          that one on.
               (somewhat to herself)
          Joaquin will appreciate this
          one.
               (into phone)
          No, not you. Listen, I am
          going to rip your eyes out and
          shove them up your ass when I
          get there.
Cassandra looks to Liliane and gives her the ’bill
please’ symbol with her index and thumb. Liliane nods and
completes the sale. Cassandra signs while on the phone.
Dante is standing in the mirror, flushed with
excitement. She has never worn clothes this expensive
before.

                                                       23.


Liliane comes around the counter to show them out.
Dante puts on her new, FAUX FUR-COLLARED TRENCH COAT.
Liliane unlocks the door and opens it.

                  LILIANE
          It was lovely to meet you,
          Dante. Any friend of Ms.
          Constantine is a friend of
          ours. Please come see us for
          anything you need.
Liliane shakes Dante’s hand with both her hands. She
has pressed her personal business card into Dante’s
hand. Dante takes a quick look at the card and smiles.
Cassandra reaches out and closes Dante’s hand again.
She gives her a look as though to say, don’t be tacky.
Cassandra suddenly looks a bit flushed and seems to
have become a bit flustered. She almost looks soft. As
though she notices, her face suddenly hardens again,
she releases Dante’s hand and quickens the exit.
                   CASSANDRA
          Thank you, Liliane. You are a
          gem.   Now,    I    have   an
          appointment with a client,
          so I must be off.
Cassandra turns around and leaves.

                    DANTE
          Thank you, Ms. Liliane. I
          really appreciate your help.
                    LILIANE
          They will be delivered to
          your office today. Would you
          like your original clothing
          delivered as well?
Dante takes a moment to consider.

                    DANTE
          No, thank you Liliane. You can
          burn those.
Liliane smiles graciously and lets her out the front
door. As Dante leaves, we see her look back. Liliane
is still standing at the door smiling and nodding in
goodbye. Dante smiles warmly back.

                                                       24.


EXT. SAK’S FIFTH AVE - LATE MORNING - CONTINUOUS

Dante turns and we see that she is surrounded by a sea
of swarming taxis. The streets are steamy as the sun
is now beaming brightly down on this glorious winter
day in NYC. Dante takes a deep breath and smiles.
As she scans the bustling city scene for Cassandra, we
see her getting into a cab. Dante walks towards her,
somewhat unsteady in her new heels.
Cassandra sees her and lowers her window. She has her
phone in her hand that she uses emphatically.
                     CASSANDRA
           One more thing Dante... don’t
           you dare puke tonight. I’ve spent
           a lot of fucking money on you.
             (beat)
          You look good.
             (beat; intense)
          Oh, and Dante... don’t ask,
          don’t tell.
             (beat)
          You should get back to work.
Cassandra tells the cab driver where to go while
simultaneously answering her ringing phone and putting
the window up. The cab takes off before Dante can
respond.
Cassandra’s cab whizzes off leaving Dante
stranded, confused, yet strangely empowered.
After a beat, she starts to hail a cab.

EXT. TWIN TOWERS
Dante gets out of the cab and looks up at the towers.
She takes a deep breath and smiles before walking in.

INT. BEL INC. OFFICE - 11:30AM
DING! The elevator doors open and we see Dante struggling
to walk in her new HIGH HEELS.
Dante looks around. She has never seen anything like
it in her life. There are well over 30 brokers
speaking on their phones simultaneously. Some are
shouting at computer screens, some at TV screens,
some at each other.

                                                       25.


They are wading in a sea of white, crumpled, tiny
PAPER droppings.
She appears frozen in her tracks, as she has no idea
what to do or where to go.
Greta sees her coming and goes straight to her.
                    GRETA
          Ah!   You    look    absolutely
          stunning. It is so wonderful to
          have another female around
          here, and a beautiful one at
          that.

                  DANTE
          Thank you, Greta. I hope I
          wasn’t gone too long. I
          couldn’t seem to hail a
          cab...
                  GRETA
          I wouldn’t worry about that.
          You still don’t know how
          things work around here.
Greta gives Dante a little wink.


                  GRETA (CONT’D)
          Well, shall we continue our
          tour? Show off this beautiful
          outfit!
                  DANTE
          Yes... I, uh, did a little
          shopping...
                  GRETA
          Wise choice, love. Well, we
          might as well start with my
          office.
Greta starts to walk down the hall, beckoning Dante to
join her.
They head up the stairs to the 3rd level towards a
desk facing the pit.

                                                       26.


INT. BEL INC. - GRETA’S DESK - MORNING

Greta’s desk is beautiful. Her area is decorated in
mostly yellow. It is very cozy and somehow feels like
a country home. As soon as Dante enters, Greta,
seemingly psychic, has already poured her a giant
GLASS of water and hands her a TYLENOL. She picks up
a box of BAND-AIDS and removes two.
                  GRETA
          Self-care is key. Always take
          care of yourself first.
Greta looks at her intently. Dante nods and downs the
water and pill, while Greta kneels and puts the band-
aids on the backs of her ankles.
                  DANTE
               (looking down at Greta)
          I think I’m starting to
          understand why everyone calls
          you ’Greatness’.
Greta looks up at her with a large smile.
                  GRETA
          Let’s leave that coat in my
          office for now.

Dante hands her the coat and Greta hangs it on a hook.
INT. BEL INC. CORRIDOR - RIGHT OF THE PIT (CONTINUOUS)
As they leave her office, we see that Greta is proud
of her position, and it shows. She is aware of
everyone around her and what they are doing -- even
if she doesn’t acknowledge it.
                    GRETA
               (pointing at the desk
               they just left)
          I am usually on the top
          level, but if you don’t see
          me there, don’t worry. Leave
          me a note and I will get back
          to you as soon as I can.
As they head back down the stairs, Dante and Greta
see the SHOE REPAIR GUY, (small, 50-something,
nervous looking Italian man), frantically buffing
Abe’s shoes. No one knows his actual name, nor do
they seem to care. Abe is reading the NEWSPAPER and
doesn’t look up.

                                                      27.


                    ABE
          Make sure you have new laces
          for me tomorrow.
                    SHOE REPAIR GUY
          You got ’er Mr. Hinkley.
Greta gestures towards the Shoe Repair Guy and Abe.
                    GRETA
          You should know that Joaquin
          insists that everyone has
          their shoes buffed on
          Thursdays. In fact, it is
          company policy. You will see
          that in ’the book’ you
          receive tomorrow.
Dante smiles. She has never, in her entire life,
had anything polished for her.
Abe peers over his newspaper and looks Dante up and
down. Dante becomes so flustered that she trips towards
Greta. Greta catches her. Abe looks down at his
newspaper.
                    GRETA (CONT’D)
          Oopsies! I’ve got you Dante.
          It looks like you may need a
          little more help walking for
          a bit.
Greta smiles and takes her arm. Dante is flushed with
embarrassment as she looks back to Abe. Only, Abe
seems to be gone, and we see XANDER, (handsome, shy,
30-something man), just sitting down in his spot.

                    XANDER
          Just what’s necessary, please.
                    SHOE REPAIR GUY
          You got it, Mr. Lavery.
As the shoe repair guy shakes his head and gets to
work, Xander looks up at Dante ’walking’. Greta is
moving her along.
Greta is pointing to an elevator. She is speaking
loudly as they are right in front of the pit where
brokers are shouting at their various technologies.
Each of them is outfitted with a beeper, and each
manager is outfitted with a pager and a beeper. We
hear these beeping and vibrating randomly constantly.

                                                         28.


                      GRETA
            As you are allowed 5-minute
            smoke breaks, you can take
            that elevator down to ’P’ to
            the smoking cage.
            The cafeteria is on the 30th
            floor, the mall is on the
            train level.
                 (she points to an
                 elevator across from
                 them on the floor below)
            Never use this one. This one is for
            executives only.

Greta gives her a gentle but knowing smile.

                      DANTE
            Ummm…I don’t smoke?
                        GRETA
            You will.
  They move past the elevator and Greta points to a spot
  above the pit. It is all mirrored windows, including
  the door.
                    GRETA
            That is Joaquin’s office. You
            may not be able to see in,
            but rest assured, if he’s in
            his office, he is always
            watching. It’s best not to
            disturb him...
                 (beat)
            ... ever.
  Greta smiles again and takes her towards the pit. She
  points to the back offices behind it.


                    GRETA
            In those back offices are
            Tina and Benny. They receive
            your tickets and take care of
            it from there.
  CROOKED TITS (mousy woman in her 40s), looks up from
  her desk. Her eyes squint at Dante. She looks
  unimpressed, purses her lips and looks back down.
  Benny, (late 30s, handsome and unassuming), looks up
  and smiles.

                                                       29.


Dante is clinging to Greta’s arm for support. Some
brokers are starting to turn and are laughing amongst
each other. Greta and Dante stop in front of the pit.

                  GRETA
              (claps her hands)
          Everyone! Listen up!
We see and hear the muffled sounds of about 30
brokers putting their clients on hold. We see Laynah
on the phone with her back to Dante and Greta. She
turns around, looks Dante up and down, then turns to
resume her phone call. All other eyes are on Dante.
                  GRETA
          This is Dante. This is her
          first day...
We see that the brokers are a bit confused and looking
at each other.
                    GRETA
               (teasingly)
          ... so, you bad boys be good
          to her. She is a very, very
          sweet girl and needs a hearty
          welcome from all of you.
               (she gives a look to a
               couple of the brokers)
Dante nervously looks around. All is quiet except
the muffled voice of Laynah in the background.
The crowd erupts. It is like a Circus of Idiots. Each
idiot encouraging the next with some whistling at Dante.
One broker starts imitating Dante’s walk crudely.
                    MIKE THE SHIT
          Don’t worry Dante, I love the
          handicapped!

Another is bobbing his head up and down between
another broker’s legs. He is giving him an air
blowie.
                    BROKER
          This is how we show our love
          around here, Dante!
We hear the broker receiving the blowie having a
giant orgasm and pounding his chest.

                                                       30.


                    MIKE CHRISTIAN
          Yes. YES. YESSSSS!!!! I LOVE YOU
          DANTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!!!!!!!!!!
Another broker is unbuttoning his dress shirt and ripping
it open, massaging his chest hair and nipples roughly.
                    BROKER
          Hey Dante! I would love to
          see a little more of your
          neckline...I mean, chest
          line. Fuck it. Your tits!
Greta is just laughing as though they are her children
doing a fun skit they made for mom.
                    GRETA
          Oh, you boys.
                 (to Dante)
          They are incredibly
          incorrigible. But I do love
          them. And you’ll grow to love
          them too.
               (she puts her
          hands up) Ok, boys.
          Settle down.
Dante waits a beat deciding if she should respond to
the crowd or not.
                  DANTE
          Hello everyone. I look
          forward to working with all of
          you. I’m... I’m ready to learn
          everything I can.
The room is quiet save for a few brokers piping up to say
immature shit like, "shower! shower!", "$100 to you if it
sticks!" while a broker is holding up a quarter or
flicking their tongues between their ’v’ fingers at their
mouth.
We are unsure if she is going to speak again. Slowly, she
takes off her heels. There's a moment where they wonder
if she's going to strip. For once, it quiets everyone.
Laynah peers over.

                  DANTE
          And... you should know that I
          may not know how to use these
          for walking ...
               (holds up a HIGH HEEL)
          but, I certainly know how
          to use them as a weapon.

                                                    31.


Without skipping a beat, Dante swiftly whips it like a
throwing star towards the cork board at the opposite
wall, hitting a paper perfectly in the center. We see
that it is a defaced PICTURE OF CLINTON. The crowd is
quiet and then erupts into voracious laughter, whooping
and clapping before resuming their phone calls.
Greta turns to Dante and winks.
                  GRETA
          Well played. I think that you
          will fit in here just fine.
Greta starts walking her to her new desk. Dante is
walking steady and confident in her bare feet, one heel
in hand. The men are all back on their calls and a
couple even turn to Dante with approving nods.
The defaced picture of Clinton falls unceremoniously to
the ground.

INT. 2ND LEVEL TRADING PIT - DANTE’S DESK
They reach Dante’s desk - it is curved, institutional,
and battle-scarred. Laminate top chipped at the edges,
scratched from years of frantic notetaking. Built like a
tank to withstand the daily assault of Wall Street
intensity.
We see YURI,(40-something man with salt-and-pepper hair),
at the desk beside, face down, and one pant leg wet on
the inside.
                  GRETA
          I’ll be right back. This will
          be your desk. So, please make
          yourself comfortable.
Greta swiftly exits and Dante takes a moment to look
around and take in her surroundings. The people, the
office, the din, the chaos. She smiles and places her
new purse on her desk.
Mike the Shit looks up from the desk on the floor
immediately below and pipes up.

                                                     32.



                  MIKE THE SHIT
                    (into phone)
          Holy shit! Everyone is on the
          phone right now buying Cisco
          up! Let me call my supervisor
          over to
          pre-approve you for more shares...
Mike hits the hold button and puts the phone to his chest.
                  MIKE THE SHIT (CONT’D)
          Hey Laynah, I thought Abe
          told you to leave your dirty
          man whores at home? This one
          pissed himself!
Laynah, mid-phone dial, peeks out from the other side
of Mike’s desk.
                    LAYNAH
          This one is a welcome present
          for our ’new broker’.
We see Greta rushing back like a Geisha to her top
client. She has a fresh pair of SLACKS in one hand
and a GLASS OF WATER in another. She is back in an
abnormally fast time.
                    LAYNAH (CONT’D)
                  (to Dante)
          You may wanna have Greta take
          this one to the cleaners
          first.
For the first time, Dante sees a slightly unimpressed
look on Greta’s face as she ignores Laynah’s comment.
Mike and Laynah are back on their phones.
Greta picks up his head, shoves a strange colored pill
in his mouth and force feeds him the water. She has her
back to Dante to try and create some privacy with the
scene.
                    GRETA
          Come now Yuri. Let’s get you
          cleaned up.

Greta helps him up while he mumbles what sounds
like Russian and starts grabbing at her breasts.

                                                       33.


                   YURI
              (in Russian)
          Boobies…

Greta turns her head back to Dante for a moment.


                   GRETA
          Tennie will get you set up. I
          hope you can excuse me.
                   DANTE
          Of course.
Dante turns back to her desk to see Tennessee. He is
already into her computer typing madly. Things seem to
move incredibly fast around here. He doesn’t acknowledge
her.
She looks down at Mike the Shit, who is leaned back in
his chair on the phone, looking at her. He turns back
towards his computer, talking to his client.
In the background, she sees Abe standing by a post. He
has one hand in a slight fist, elegantly placed just
in front of his chest, and the other arm behind him.
The calmness that he exudes is in stark contrast to
the frenzy of the crowd.
He has been watching her, but we have no idea for how
long. He lifts a finger and beckons her over.
                    DANTE
          Excuse me, Tennessee.
                    TENNESSEE
          Tennie. Only my mom calls me
          by my full name.
Tennie doesn’t look up from the computer screen. Other
than what he said, he seems barely aware of anyone’s
presence.
She heads over immediately.
                    ABE
          I’m taking you to lunch Dante.
Seemingly more like a command than a request, Dante
quickly eyes the clock. It is almost 1pm. Abe’s gaze
is steady and unreadable.

                                                       34.


                   DANTE
          Yes, of course, Abe. Let me
          grab my purse.
                   ABE
          That won’t be necessary.
He smiles for the first time at her. A smile that is
impossible to read. From behind his back, he produces
her ’throwing star’ missing heel as well as her coat
that she left at the bar. Dante sheepishly takes her
items back.
                    DANTE
             (laughing nervously)
          No shirt, no shoes, no service?
He turns and glides like an electric eel through the
brokers. Dante quickly follows behind like a lost
duckling, high heels in hand. Without looking behind
him:
                    ABE
          And put your god damn shoes on.
Dante scrambles to put her heels on only to re-commence
her awkward walk. She hears snickering behind her.
They head to the broker elevator this time rather than
the Michaelangelean executive elevator she took with
Cassandra.
Dante slips in and stands beside Abe just as the door
is about to close. He is stoic and refined. She is
flustered and sweaty.
DING! The doors close.

                         END OF ACT TWO

                                                       35.


                          ACT THREE

INT. GEMINI’S BAR - 1PM
Emma is smiling. The scene mirrors exactly what we saw
a few hours prior with Dante and Cassandra - same
seats, different meeting. There is a ’Groundhog’s Day’
feel for a beat. Abe’s pager and beeper are on the bar
between them, and he checks them periodically when
Dante is speaking.
                    ABE
          Would you like an orange
               juice?
             (he eyes his watch)
          It’s still morning.
Dante feels immediately sick. Abe nods to the
bartender as she goes off to makes the drinks.


                    DANTE
          I... I would love one.
          I always start the day with a
          juice. You know, a kick of
          vitamin C to keep my immune
          system strong --
                    ABE
          -- How is your first day
          going so far?
            (looks her up and down)
          I see that you are very
          comfortable with your new
          position.
Emma arrives just in time with what looks like the
exact same drinks as earlier. Dante, grateful this
time, shoots it back. Abe takes a small and graceful
sip.
                  ABE
          Dante. Take it easy. It’s
          still early.
                    DANTE
          Sorry. I guess I was thirsty.
          Uh, maybe I’ll just get a
          tea?
                    ABE
          No. You’ll get another juice,
          but you’ll pace yourself.

                                                    36.


                      DANTE
          Yes, sir.
                  ABE
          -- Sir? What happened to the
          girl earlier this morning who
          was spouting off about money,
          power, and prestige?
               (he laughs)
          You didn’t even have shoes on
          10 minutes ago.
Abe smiles at her.
                    ABE (CONT’D)
          Go ahead and order another.
Dante tries to catch Emma’s eye and starts tapping the
bar with two fingers. Tap tap. Tap TAP. Abe appears
to be scrutinizing her methods, adding to her
nervousness.
TAP TAP TAP TAP!
Emma is at the other end chatting up another customer.
Dante puts her fingers in her mouth and whistles. Abe
grabs her hand out of her mouth and pulls it down to
the bar, holding it tightly. Emma shoots her a glare.
                    ABE
          That, you shall never do again.
                    DANTE
          Right. Sorry.
Whilst still holding Dante’s hand and gaze, he
elegantly taps his fingers on the bar twice. If you
saw only this moment in time, you would think that
Abe is training a monkey. Emma starts preparing their
drinks. Dante looks mortified.
                    ABE
          (still gripping her hand)
          Let’s hear your story.
Dante hiccups and covers her mouth, mortified.
                    DANTE
                (embarrassed)
          Well, breakfast booze is new to me.
Dante shifts in her seat, trying to find a nonchalant
way to get her hand back.

                                                       37.


                  ABE
          Let’s hear the parts of your
          story that aren’t glaringly
          obvious.
                   (beat)
          Wait. Let me guess.
Abe is looking at her studiously.
The drinks arrive and Abe doesn’t break his gaze.
Dante looks to Emma apologetically. Emma glowers and
walks away.
He continues to study her up and down slowly. Taking
his time at each body part. Dante instinctively closes
her body inwards. Abe reaches forward and slowly
unwinds her.

He takes all of her in before leaning forward. In
vampirish fashion, he inhales her decolletage deeply
and slowly. There is an extended beat as we see his
mouth slowly open by her neck.
                  ABE
          ... pine-sol soap...
             (inhales again)
          ahhh...there is a perfume...
          yes... Lysol. Dumpy-ass motel scent.

He tightens his grip on her hand. She winces.

          Am I right?
              (beat)
          Wait...
               (fondling a tag left on
               her suit jacket)
          Mmmmmm...
               yes --
Abe sits back and finally releases the tight grip on
her hand.
                    ABE
          -- Cassandra popped your Saks
          cherry.
Dante immediately pulls her hand in and
instinctively massages it.
Dante is looking back at him blankly.
Abe breaks into a somewhat demented and creepy laughter.

                                                      38.


He slaps Dante on the back.
                     ABE
             (off her reaction)
          I’m just trying to get a rise
          out of you.
              (beat)
          Seriously. I would like to
          hear your story.
Dante is clearly in way over her head and is trying to
stay in control. Abe taps the bar for 2 more juices.

                    DANTE
          Ah, two more juices.
          Excellent.
While she is speaking, Abe is pulling out a giant
WAD OF MONEY in a gold MONEY CLIP. Each bill seems
to be a $100 bill, and there appear to be about 1.5
inches of them. Emma places a fresh juice in front
of each of them.
Abe unfurls his wad and passes Emma a few of the bills.
                    ABE
          (over)-- Let’s keep ’em
          coming for the rest of the
          day Emma.
Abe takes another quick look at Dante.
                  ABE
               (off Dante)
          Let’s make that day, and
          night. BEL-Style.

He flicks another couple hundreds at her. It doesn’t
seem to diminish the wad thickness at all. Emma smiles
professionally and heads off to make another round.
Emma doesn’t seem fazed by the amount of money just
thrown at her.
                  ABE
          Go on...

INT. GEMINI’S BAR VIP ROOM - LATER
Dante and Abe are deep in conversation in a private VIP
room booth. Abe’s scotch glass is half-empty and
Dante’s scotch glass is full. Dante is visibly drunk,
and she is eating the last of the pretzels in a bowl
right in front of her.

                                                    39.


                  DANTE
          --that’s why I work as hard
          as I do. Let’s just say I
          learned early that no one was
          gonna hand me anything. I
          will never go back...
          Excuse me --
               (crying)
          -- Sorry, I don’t
          usually...
Abe passes her a napkin off the table. She dabs below
her eyes, somewhat missing part of the make-up in her
state.
                  DANTE
          Shit. I hate talking about my
          family.
            (studying him intensely)
          I never talk about this
          stuff.
Dante looks to Abe as he nods politely. He seems like a
different person than before - soft, kind, heartfelt
even.
Dante dabs below her eyes again and blows her nose with
the napkin. She takes a deep breath and collects herself.
                  DANTE
          Can I tell you something Abe?

                  ABE
          Sure thing.
Dante leans in.
                 DANTE
         I have never worn heels in my
         entire life.
             (beat)
         Shhhhhhhh...

Abe takes a moment to look at her incredulously.
                  ABE
          Oh. Oh.
             (patting himself down)
          Give me a moment here to
          find my surprise face.

                                                       40.


They have a laugh together and we see Dante clearly
relieved at the lightness she has found with Abe. We
see the bartender bringing over new DRINKS plus 2
SHOTS. She sets them on the table and cleans the
empties off.
                 DANTE
         Ugh. I’m sick of talking
         about my life.
             (studying Abe’s face)
         How did you really know about
         my past?
Abe takes a moment to consider his response. He takes
a large sip of his drink and downs his shot. Dante
downs her shot as well.
                 ABE
         I have a knack. I can read
         people.   I used to think
         everybody could do it.
                 DANTE
         Yah. No.

                 ABE
         I learned that during my first
         fist fight in grade 7. I was
         small for my age, so when I
         entered junior high, the
         taller boys started to pick
         on me.
              (beat)
         There was one gang, The
         Bloodgang, not very original
         I know, that
         was... particularly
         intimidating. One day, the
         leader, Civatrelli, and his 4
         thug friends gathered around
         me in a circle. To further
         the cliché, they wanted my
         lunch money. Civatrelli was
         punching my shoulder to
         weaken my will. (beat) I
         don’t know how else to
         explain this, but suddenly,
         all I saw was... truth. It
         was almost as though I could
         see a life map inside of him.
              (beat)
         I went on to tell him about
         (MORE)

                                          41.


                  ABE (CONT’D)
          his whore mother, who cheated
          on his father, with his best
          friend. And, when he was left
          home alone with his uncle,
          while his mom was off
          whoring, his uncle was
          diddling him in his bed.
               (beat)
          The shock on their faces was
          my first indication that
          there was something unique
          about what I could see. I
          don’t know if I just read
          people well or if it is some
          extra-sensory gift.
                    DANTE
          So, what happened?
                    ABE
          Oh... I had the living SHIT
          beat out of me. And they took
          my lunch money.
He laughs, with Dante following suit.


                    ABE (CONT’D)
          But they never came near me
          again.
          I admired their power and
          audacity. How they just took
          whatever they wanted. I
          studied them for the rest of
          the year, spying on their
          bullying. Eventually, I
          became a part of their
          group... their secret weapon,
          if you will.
                    DANTE
          So, this is your secret to
          your success?

                    ABE
          I would say that is part of
          it, yes. I learned a lot
          about the power of knowing
          the truth that day. And
          learning how to get what you
          want.
          (MORE)

                                                    42.


As Dante takes this in, she looks around the bar. It
is starting to fill. Her eyes settle on a 30-
something, incredibly handsome male at the end of the
bar. Abe turns to study him intensely.

                    ABE (CONT’D)
          Mmm. Wanna-be. Bullshit bar
          stool philosopher. I’d say
          a... substitute teacher.
          Hoping to be noticed by a
          higher up in our business to
          make the amount of money he
          tells the ladies he makes.
          (beat) Player. Has had an
          ugly girlfriend since high
          school who pays for his life.
          She thinks he is volunteering
          at the high school right now.
Dante looks around and settles on a very well-
dressed, woman sitting at a booth with an older
gentleman.
                    ABE (CONT’D)
          Ah yes. My guess would be a
          high-end escort. Daddy ran
          off with a younger woman when
          she was just a child. Mother
          raised her and her 5 siblings
          alone on a cashier’s wage. She
          got into the biz to help her
          family.
Dante looks impressed.

                    DANTE
          You are a fascinating man.
          (beat) Thank you so much for
          hiring me. It’s truly such an
          honour to be --
                    ABE
          -- you don’t actually think
          you are hired do you?
Dante is laughing while Abe’s face darkens.

                                                    43.



                 ABE (CONT’D)
         We don’t just take any Spic
         with a rack off the street
         and make them richer than a
         Colombian fucking drug lord!
              (laughs)
         There is a process, Dante.
               (beat)
         So here is the way it works.
         If you make it through the
         night --and please take this
         all in at once, because I hate
         repeating myself-- I expect
         you to get to work early. If
         you are late, you may get
         cut. Period.
         Also, if you have any
         complaints, keep them to
         yourself. Usually, we are too
         busy to give a fuck, and if it
         is important enough, you will
         remember it when we aren’t
         busy.
              (beat)
         Which never happens. My
         suggestion is to run it past
         Greta. She has been around
         long enough to let you know
         if you are complaining about
         something petty, or if you
         have a verifiable issue.
         Next, be yourself. Don’t try
         to be like anyone else in
         this firm. If I wanted a
         fucking clone, I would’ve
         gone to the Roslin Institute.
         But, if you do want to
         emulate someone, then
         continue to follow Cassandra.
         That woman knows how to make
         money.
              (beat)
         Oh, and never ask me a
         question twice. If I don’t
         answer it the first time,
         it’s because I have no
         intention of answering.
He sits back in his chair slowly and takes a deep
breath. He tips back the rest of his scotch. His hand
goes up to the approaching bartender in a ’stop’
gesture.

                                                       44.


After an uncomfortably long beat:

                    ABE (CONT’D)
          You need two giant balls to
          work here, Dante. Do you have
          two giant balls?
 Dante is speechless and cannot get a beat on him.
                    ABE (CONT’D)
          DO YOU? DO YOU HAVE TWO GIANT
          BALLS?
                    DANTE
          Yes. Yes, I do.
Abe takes a moment to look at her.
                    ABE
          No. No you don’t. You’re a
          woman. You have a little
          flower vagina. I have two
          giant balls. Two giant balls
          made of pure gold.
Abe is grabbing his testicles firmly.
                    ABE (CONT’D)
          Do you want to see them?
Abe is shaking his testicles up and down. He drops them
and leans forward.
                   ABE (CONT’D)
          And let me tell you something.
          That SHIT you pulled during
          your interview this
          morning...
               (intensifying)
          in your CHEAP HOOKER outfit...
Abe is now poking her shoulder, harder and harder.
Dante grabs the side of the table to steady herself.
His eyes are blazing and intense as lasers.
                   ABE (CONT’D)
          ... is never, EVER going to
          happen again. Do you hear me?
               (shouting)
          I AM RICH. I AM POWERFUL. AND
          NO ONE, AND I MEAN NO ONE,
          FUCKS WITH ME.

                                                       45.


Dante is frozen in terror. Abe is sweating. He sits back
and calms himself. He takes a small POCKET SQUARE from
his suit pocket and serenely wipes his upper lip. We see
some brokers quickly glance over.

                  ABE (CONT’D)
          The only reason you are
          sitting here today is because
          of the power of Cassandra’s
          pussy. That pussy’s got
          fangs.

Abe takes a large breath.
                  ABE (CONT’D)
          Now, I am going to tell you
          something that is going to
          stay between you and me.
Abe leans in. Dante can barely find her voice. Dante
leans in cautiously.
                       DANTE
          Of course.
                    ABE
          This is very serious Dante.
Abe leans in further and lowers his voice.
                    ABE (CONT’D)
         One of the men, here tonight...
                  (beat)
         ... has... one nut.
                       DANTE
          Sorry?
Abe appears exasperated.
                    ABE
          Nut, Dante. NUT.
          Ball. Fuck orb. Ass slapper.
          Tea bag. TESTICLE.
Abe sits back smugly and smiles. He is quite visibly
drunk.
                    DANTE
          One... nut. Okay. One nut. Alright.

                                                    46.




The doors fly open to the private room and in walk a
steady stream BROKERS. CIGARETTES hanging out of their
mouths. We see them smirking at Dante and heading to an
adjacent booth. She looks at the front of everyone’s
pants and quickly looks away.
Abe leans forward.
                    ABE
                 (quietly)
          Here are the rules: You have
          the rest of tonight to find
          out who our nutless Joe is.
          Without divulging our secret,
          of course. If you are
          correct in identifying
          this ball-less wonder, you
          can start your training. If
          you are incorrect, Dante, it’s
          back to your ship-wrecked
          whore momma to scrub toilets
          on the Upper East Side. Or
          any of the other fuck shit
          welfare slave jobs from your
          Dominican sob story.
                    (beat)
          You can let me know who it
          is. 7am tomorrow morning.
               (looks at his phone,
               lights blinking with
               messages waiting)
          Now, I’ve wasted enough time
          here and have a lot of work
          to get back to. I leave you
          with the Band of Idiots.
With that, Abe stands up to make an announcement.

                    ABE (CONT’D)
          WELL. EVERYONE!

The motley mob miraculously quiets and looks up towards
him. He is truly commandeering.
                    ABE (CONT’D)
          IT’S BEEN A SLICE, BUT IT IS
          TIME FOR THIS OLE PENCIL-NECKED
          PRICK TO LEAVE.
Abe ends his announcement looking at Dante and
smiling. Abe wags his finger at Dante for all to see.

                                                      47.


  He suddenly seems stone sober.
                     ABE (CONT’D)
            Remember what I told you
            Dante -- unless you want to
            join madre...
  He puts his fingers up to his lips.

                    ABE (CONT’D)
               ...shhhhhhhhhh.
               (beat)

            Have at ’er boys. This one
            was nursed on Coors Light, so
            no need to break the bank.
  Abe leaves through the VIP room doors.


  Flickers through the swinging doors reveal Abe with
  the 'teacher' and 'high end hooker' from his psychic
  reading hours earlier. They're greeting him like old
  friends. Dante's laugh is bitter - she realizes she's
  been conned.
                      DANTE
                (to the brokers)
            I need... I need to use the
            washroom. Excuse me.


INT. GEMINIS WASHROOM

  Dante stares at her blurry reflection in the mirror. A
  silent pep talk seems to be taking place as she glances
  toward the door - weighing her escape. She looks back at
  the mirror, studying her drunken reflection for a few
  beats. Stay or go?

  Her expression shifts - from uncertainty to something
  deeper. Whatever she's thinking about, it's bigger than
  this moment. Her jaw sets with quiet determination. Two
  years. She only needs two years.

  She takes her pulse at her wrist - elevated. Pulls down
  her lower lip in the mirror, checking circulation.

  Knowing she has a narrow window before full absorption,
  she kneels by the toilet and forces herself to vomit.

                                                         48.


  Back at the sink, she turns on the tap and drinks heavily
  from her cupped hands, rehydrating. She pulls a granola
  bar from her purse and devours it to slow any remaining
  alcohol absorption.

  She takes a deep breath, straightens her shoulders, and
  heads back out.

INT. PRIVATE VIP ROOM - GIANT BOOTH - 5PM
  Dante is sandwiched in the middle of a semi-circle in
  the booth between Dunaway (sweet, shy, geeky broker
  in his 20s) Mike the Shit, Mike Christian (tall,
  sweet, even-tempered broker in his 30s) and Yuri (who
  looks as though he has seen better days). In the
  center of the table are ICE BINS chilling 3 BOTTLES
  OF VEUVE.
  There are many, many SHOOTERS on the table, all still
  full. In fact, every inch is filled. In this sea of
  shooters, we see 4 FLUTE GLASSES.
  Dunaway reaches over and grabs a Veuve.

                    MIKE THE SHIT
            Can we pop this for you?
  The boys snicker.
                      DANTE
            I’d like to see you try.
  The group gives a bit of an ’ooooooohhhh, ahhhhhhh’
  and laughs.
  Dunaway tries to pop the cork. He cannot seem to get it.

                      MIKE CHRISTIAN
            Seriously? Pass that over.
  He grabs the bottle from Dunaway and tries with even
  greater fervor. He cannot get it.
                      MIKE THE SHIT
            PUSSIES! Yuri would have a
            better chance of opening it
            than you two faggots.
  We see a quick shot of Yuri again. He is quiet and
  wan. Barely present.
  Mike the Shit snatches the bottle away and goes at it
  with great difficulty.

                                                     49.



KENSINGTON, (gorgeous 30-something Amazonian
bartender) is dressed in a sports HALTER TOP and
tight SKIRT. She is part owner of this bar, and it
shows in her actions. She is watching all of this and
walks over, GIANT SABRE in hand that she has just
taken from her BELT.
She grabs the bottle and sabers it. Perfectly. She
pours up the flutes and keeps walking.
Everyone laughs except Mike the Shit.
Mike the Shit picks up his flute glass. The rest of the
guys follow suit. We see Dunaway placing a flute in
Yuri’s hand. He shakily lifts his flute glass to join
the others.
                    MIKE THE SHIT
          Welcome to the firm...
               (reconsiders a beat)
          Whoa. Whoa. Wait.
Mike the Shit takes a long look at Dante.
                    MIKE THE SHIT
          I’m not going to cheers with
          her until she tells us what
          Abe said.
               (he intensifies his
          stare)
          What was that secret all
          about? Hey, Dante?
Dante freezes for a moment.

                    MIKE CHRISTIAN
          Yah, good point Mike.
          (turns to Dante)
          No secrets in this firm. Not
          wise to get off to a bad
          start with us. We’re your
          allies. (beat) Management
          will just use you to get what
          they want. We are the ones who
          support each other. And since
          Abe isn’t exactly an open
          book, we need to know any
          grain of information that he
          may divulge. Now, ’fess up.
They are all nodding. Yuri nods with a delay.

                                                       50.


Dante sits back and nonchalantly looks at Mike
Christian’s crotch beside her. We see a bit of a
bulge, but it is hard to tell in suit pants. She is
feigning that she is thinking and rubbing the back of
her neck.

                  MIKE THE SHIT
          Were you just staring at
          Mike’s crotch?
                  MIKE CHRISTIAN
          No secrets between us, right?
          9 inches.
They all burst out laughing. Dante immediately tries
to change the subject.
                  DANTE
          Sooo, how long you guys been
          at the firm?
                  MIKE THE SHIT
          Don’t try and change the
          subject. How about we play a
          little drinking game, winner
          gets the secret? A little,
          ’who here owns... ?’ game?
Nods all around. Everyone reaches for a shot.

                  MIKE THE SHIT
          Who here owns a Porsche?
No one drinks.
                    DUNAWAY
          If you don’t, you have to drink.
                    DANTE
          Ok, wait, wait. This isn’t
          fair. I just started here...
                    MIKE THE SHIT
          It’s the rules. We all play
          by the rules. Don’t we guys?
They are all nodding. Dante tips back her shot.

                     MIKE THE SHIT
          Next question. Who here owns
          a mansion in The Hamptons.
          (to Dante)
          Do you? Drink up.

                                                      51.


The guys are laughing and drinking their champagne. As
Dante reaches for a shot –

INT. PRIVATE VIP ROOM - DOORWAY
--BAM! The deep brown leather, brass-trimmed, saloon-
style doors to the room fly open. Joaquin enters
quickly, 1 GIANT MOTOROLA CELL PHONE in each hand, one
to his ear, one on his chest. He has a cigar hanging
out of his mouth, plumes of smoke billowing upwards.
                  JOAQUIN
               (into phone, very loud)
          ...you want what? Hold on...
          I’m on an important call.

He puts that phone to his chest and takes the other
one to his ear.
                  JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
               (into phone)
          Ok. 3 pairs of Valentino
          custom made. Have ’em here by
          next week. And don’t you dare
          send me that ass hide you
          tried selling me last week.
          Alright... bye-bye.
He hangs that phone up and takes the one on his chest
up to his ear.
                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
          Tamara... honey. What’s wrong
          with your Maserati? Don’t you
          have homework? Go make
          yourself a stiff drink until
          the craving passes.
He hangs up and loudly bangs both phones on the bar
like setting his rifles down at the end of the day.
                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
               Chewie!
We can see that Kensington loves his humor and equally
loves to sass him back.
                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
               (pointing to the TVs
               above the bar playing
               the news)
          Turn that shit up!

                                                      52.


                    KENSINGTON
               (while grabbing the
               remote)
               Fuck you, Joaquin.
Joaquin looks towards the booth, impressed that she
just said ’fuck you’ to him.
We see the brokers in the booth laughing.
He extends his arms to their furthest length on the
bar wood while still looking at the booth.
                    JOAQUIN
          I want this many shots! Make
          them from the House of
          Cognac..
Joaquin is still looking at the booth, especially
Dante, eyes twinkling.
Kensington starts setting up SHOT GLASSES between his
hands. His hands don’t move.
Everyone at the booth leans back, laughing.
                    DUNAWAY
          Herrrrrre comes The Joaquin
          Show. Brace yourself Dante.
The group is laughing and nodding as they all nurse a
shot.
                    JOAQUIN
          Hey... HEY! Make ’em tight as
          your arse, Blanche.
Dante watches as Kensington fills every square inch of
space between his outstretched arms with shooters. We
also notice that she is pouring from the LOUIS XIII
CRYSTAL BOTTLE, $10,000/bottle.
Mike Christian nods his head towards Mike the Shit.
                    MIKE CHRISTIAN
          Just be happy Mike’s not
          ordering the shots.
Mike the Shit gives him a long-armed punch from across the
table. To Dante:
             MIKE CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
          See what I mean?

                                                       53.


Joaquin lumbers over with 2 shots in each hand,
fingers in the shot glasses and giant phones under his
armpits. The humor in his walk is only exacerbated by
the bulky pager and beeper hanging off his belt loops.

In the b.g. Kensington is loading the rest of the
shots; a double-decker tray.
                    JOAQUIN
          Holy shit, what a motley crew!
          Make some room for some high
          quality.
He seems to be referring to himself and his shooters
as he pushes his way into the sardine booth, facing
the TVs. He passes Dante the two shots in his right
hand. While licking the booze off his fat finger and
thumb:
                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
               (to Dante)
          OHHHHHHH STATE! You look a fright!
          (looks at her again)
          So, how’s it goin’, Fancypants?
He looks over at Yuri, who has been quiet up to this
point. Joaquin flamboyantly jumps back in feigned fright.
                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
          Jesus! You got a face on you
          like a bag ’o smashed
          assholes! What’s the matter
          YURINE, wet undies givin’ you
          a rash?
Yuri smiles with a delay and gives a thumbs up.
                       YURI
                  (in Russian)
          Good!
Everyone is laughing. This man has a joke a second, not
that you can understand them.
                    JOAQUIN
          Holy shit. We better git some
          medicine in ya.
Kensington arrives and places all the shots Joaquin just
bought on the adjacent two-top.
                    KENSINGTON
          Startin’ out slow, are we?

                                                       54.


Joaquin is beckoning to Kensington to bring him a couple
of shots from his stash.
                    JOAQUIN
               (pointing at Kensington
               and then Yuri)
          Get me one for Yee, and one for Pee.
The group snickers. Joaquin hands it to Yuri and looks
to Dante and Kensington for a cheers.


                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
          Down the hatch.
Joaquin gives a little look to the group, and they all
grab a shot from the table. The group shoots them
back. Yuri, with a delay, shoots his back also.
                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
          Holy shit, if I wanted to
          have tea with the queen, I
          woulda went to Buckingham
          fucking palace. Come on, miss,
          let’s go.
He pushes her second shot towards her brashly. She
has a mini dry heave when she takes the shot and the
group snickers. They all join her for a second shot.
Joaquin just grabs a random from the table.
                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
               (makes a face)
          Gasoline!
Joaquin is rubbing the chest hair spewing out of his
opened dress shirt top, tie in his breast pocket. He
seems to be studying her while continuing to rub his
chest hair.
                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
          So, who made you? Two mutts?
Dante has no idea what he is talking about, and it shows.
                    MIKE CHRISTIAN
          He means, who are your parents?
Joaquin loves when someone understands what he is
saying. With a wink and a head jerk, to Mike C.:
                    JOAQUIN
          Spot on, buddy.

                                                      55.


                    MIKE CHRISTIAN
          Don’t worry, he doesn’t always
          talk like this. His Newfie
          always comes out when he
          drinks... or when it’s
          showtime.
                 JOAQUIN
       It’s NEWFOUNDLANDER to you,
         My son...
The group laughs. Joaquin looks back at Dante, awaiting
her response.
                    DANTE
          My mom is Haitian, and my dad
          is Puerto... wait, no...
          other way around... ?
Dante is laughing. She is too drunk to remember her
parents’ heritage. Joaquin is shaking his head again.
                    JOAQUIN
          Holy shit, she’s not gonna
          last a minute. Maybe you need
          a shot of PENIS-CILLIN?
He grabs his package (he likes to do this). The group
is killing themselves laughing. Dante eyes seem to
linger a bit too long on him grabbing his package as
she attempts a quick testicle count.

                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
          Ahhh, you like that? Well,
          there is a lot more where
          that came from.
The group is still laughing. He drops his package and
looks at the group as though he didn’t just do
anything raunchy.
                    JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
          So, what’s the word boys?
                    MIKE THE SHIT
          Well, Dante here has a secret
          that Abe told her. She won’t
          divulge.
                    JOAQUIN
          No secrets here, Dante. Rule #1.
Laynah walks up beside Joaquin. She has changed her
shirt so that her fake boobs are bursting out the
impossibly small bodice she’s stretched over them.

                                                       56.


She has clearly re-done her make-up, hair, and outfit.
She is smiling through her fire engine red lipstick --
which is all over her front teeth.

                    LAYNAH
          What’s going on, boys?
As we see Dante take a sigh of relief, Joaquin turns
his head right into her cleavage.
                    JOAQUIN
          Holy shit! Ma? Ma? Is that you, MA?

He is nose deep into her cleavage and is grabbing at
her breasts, as though trying to recognize them. She
slaps his hands away.
                    LAYNAH
          Screw you, Joaquin. Move over.
She barely fits herself at the end of the booth.
Dante looks to her and rubs her front teeth as though
to tell her there is lipstick on her teeth -- girl
code, and as an olive branch. She’s needs someone on
her side here.
Laynah, as usual, doesn’t understand, and pretends to
rub her front teeth right back, as though mocking
Dante’s actions. Although, she doesn’t quite touch
her teeth, so they stay stained.
Joaquin leans over to Dante and whispers. Well,
ok, he speaks loud enough for everyone to hear.
                    JOAQUIN
          Stunned as mi arse.
Laynah hits Joaquin. He laughs.
Cassandra walks through the ’saloon doors’, just
hanging up her phone. This seems to be a much looser
Cassandra than Dante from earlier as she is, yes,
dancing her way towards the bar. She is quite drunk.
She stops short of the bar and throws her arms up.
                    CASSANDRA
          This night’s on MEEEEE! WE GOT
          CANE DEEDS!
She is pointing towards Yuri.

                                                       57.


                    CASSANDRA
          That’s right my friend, we did it!
Yuri smiles and gives another thumbs up. It looks like
he has been up for days to help close this deal. We see
the guys around him congratulating him.
                    CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
          Your best tequila all around,
          Kensy!
               (beat, pointing to the
          TVs) Turn that shit down, and
          the music UP!
We see Kensington turning down the TVs and turning up the
stereo. We notice that she has turned on the TV subtitles.


The group starts clapping and whooping.
                     JOAQUIN
               (leaning into Dante)
          Don’t think we are done with you.
He puts his hand on her leg and holds it there a bit
too long.
As Cassandra dances over, we see everyone reaching for
a shot for cheers.
The music is loud, and the party has officially
started. CLINK!

GEMINI’S PRIVATE VIP ROOM - LATER

There is loud club music (something like Gypsy Kings
- Bamboleo) and flashes of VERY DRUNK QUICK CLIPS
between black transitions. We hear some dialogue here
and there. Things like, ’you wanna see the real
thing?’ when she is caught looking at someone’s
package. ’What’s the secret?’ ’What did Abe tell
you?’ ’DANTE! WHAT IS THE FUCKING SECRET?!’
Here we also see Paul and SMITH who is the co-owner of
the bar, and twin brother of Kensington. He is in his
early 30s, handsome (almost pretty), and sweet
looking. Kensington introduces him to Dante. Dunaway
and Smith are laughing together.

                                                    58.


Cassandra is on the bar table singing, Dante and
others are dancing, shooters are being tipped back,
there is lots of drinking, lots of drugs, blow off
hookers, gambling at the tables, men reaching for
their giant money wads, brokers making out with
women, Laynah giving a blowjob to a broker in a
booth, and some have their arms around each other and
are singing loudly. We really see the brotherhood,
men demeaning women, and the excessiveness in this
scene.

Everyone, including Dante, seems to be having the time
of their life.
We also see scenes of Cassandra telling her to
’straighten up/hold yourself together’ while snorting
coke from her giant, SILVER RING.

                     END OF ACT THREE

                                                       59.


                        ACT FOUR

INT. PRIVATE VIP ROOM - LATER

Dante looks quite green. She is swaying and her eyes
look like they are blinking independently of each
other. She is sweating and her make-up is running down
her face.
Joaquin notices her state, grabs her, and quickly ushers
her into the men’s washroom.

INT. GEMINIS - MEN’S WASHROOM
As they enter, we see PAUL, in front of the urinal,
just zipping up his pants under his giant gut. He
looks from Joaquin to Dante to Joaquin’s ’get the fuck
out of here’ face.
He exits very quickly without a word.
SHUNNNNNNNNNNNP. Joaquin drags the GARBAGE CAN in
front of the door.
He reaches into his pocket and takes out a rather
LARGE BAG of WHITE POWDER and a STRAW. He proceeds to
create a line on the side of the sink with his one of
his BLACK VISA CREDIT CARDS (we see him choosing).
                   JOAQUIN
          You need to straighten up.
                (passing her the straw)
          Here.
Dante has never done drugs in her life. Drinking,
yes. Drugs, no.
She is drunk. She is disinhibited. She grabs the straw
and shakily places it at the start of the line. We hear a
big SNIIIIIFFFFFFFF as the white powder slowly
disappears.
As Dante’s head comes up, we see that she has a fair
amount under her nose, and she is choking.
                  DANTE
          It musta went down the wrong tube--
Joaquin face reflects his disdain, and he hands
her his pocket napkin.

                                                       60.


                  JOAQUIN
          -- Jesus. Wipe that shit up
          newbie before someone licks
          it from yer nose. This is
          some velvety shit. Don’t
          waste it.

He takes a small, what looks like a BRASS LOCKET, out
of his other pocket. There is a small, BRASS STRAW on
top. He takes a different baggie of white powder out
of the other pocket and makes a fat line.
As his head comes up, we see his face and eyes are
blazing red. He is a whole different, and scarier,
person than earlier.
                 JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
          Enough’s enough. I’m giving
          you 3 choices: you either
          tell me Abe’s secret, I fire
          you... or (beat) you blow me.
          Right now, Spic.
Dante wildly stares at Joaquin.
After a long beat, she walks towards him slowly,
seductively. As she approaches, she lays her hand on
his giant gut. He looks at her, sweating like a pig.
Her hand slowly trails down his King Henry VIII mound,
towards his groin. She undoes his zipper. Her hand
slips in. He is smiling and his head tilts back.
She grabs his testicles hard. So much so that we see
his body slightly raise on the wall. He is wincing in
pain. All men watching the show should be saying,
Mama, along with him.
                  DANTE
               (whispering into his ear)
          Do you want to keep both of
          these, or shall I bring one
          to Abe, as bounty, and create
          my own destiny?
Joaquin is shaking his head yes, then no, then...
whatever he is trying to convey, it clearly means, LET
GO. She lets go of his testicles and we see him
slightly drop to the floor. Lower than before as he
is hunching in pain and somewhat winded.
                  JOAQUIN
               (breathlessly)
          Bitch.

                                                    61.


Dante exits the washroom.


INT. GEMINI’S BAR - 8:45PM - CONTINUOUS
Dante is coming out of the bathroom, sweating.
Xander walks straight up beside her, sipping a CLEAR
DRINK with a bobbing LIME. He says nothing to her, as
they watch the drunk insanity in front of them,
together.
Dante looks to him and sees that he is watching Dunaway
tuck into a SALAD. Her eyes follow to Dunaway eating.
                  XANDER
          You know, ever since Dunaway
          had the testicular cancer,
          he’s become a real pain in
          the ass health nut.
               (beat)
          He’s even doing yoga.
Xander hands her his drink.
                  XANDER (CONT’D)
          Here, water. You have to balance
          this.
Dante gratefully takes the water and downs it.

                  XANDER (CONT’D)
          Have you even eaten today?
Before she can respond, Joaquin storms out of the
washroom, red faced, sweaty, and freshly coked up. He
is walking a bit funny.
                 DANTE
               (to self)
          Uh-oh...

                 JOAQUIN
               (enraged and shouting)
          I think it’s time that our
          new little piggy takes herself
          alllllll the way home.
Joaquin is at the bar exit pointing at Dante and
motioning her towards the door. He is adjusting
himself in his pants.
The crowd that is close enough to hear starts

                                                      62.


laughing and oinking, before going back to their
shenanigans. Dante looks around and no one seems to
be helping her except Xander, who cocks his head
towards the door.
                       XANDER
            Go.
Dante exits quickly.

EXT. SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF TAXI
Joaquin is behind Dante, marching her out. He
immediately waves a CAB down and opens a door for
her.
                       JOAQUIN
            Get in.
As Dante heads towards the cab, we see that walking has
suddenly become very difficult. He grabs her arm and
roughly sits her in the cab, closes the door and walks
around to the CABBIE’S window. He pulls his THICK MONEY
CLIP out, full of HUNDREDS.
                      JOAQUIN (CONT’D)
            Take this ditch pig home.
The cabbie (ARMAN) is a well-manicured, AFGHAN MALE in
his 40s. Joaquin slips the cabbie $100.
                      ARMAN
                 (with a Farsi
            accent) Yes, sir.
Arman starts asking Dante where to go, we see Joaquin
moving back around the cab with a strange smile slowly
curling across his face.
He pats the back of the cab a couple of times to send
it off.
BAM! BAM!

INT. CAB - 9PM - CONTINUOUS
Fade in from black. It is quiet. Only the motor of the
cab is heard.
We see Dante wilting in the back, head in hands.

                                                    63.


                    DANTE
               (to self)
          Fuck. Fuck. Fucka. Fucka.
          Fucka. Fuck.
Dante slumps against the cab window, eyes glassy. The
city streaks past—grey apartments, neon liquor signs,
faceless corner stores—smearing together like wet paint.
All she wants is to disappear.

Arman stops in front of her building.
                    ARMAN
          That will be $20.
Dante takes a minute to look at him in the rear-view
mirror. She is blinking slowly and speaking in slurs.


                    DANTE
          Nice try.
          (peering at his tag on the dash)
          What’s your name?
                    ARMAN
          My name is Arman, Miss.
                    DANTE
          Is this fucking joke, Ar-mee?
                    ARMAN
          Sorry?
                  DANTE
          I get your opportunity eye,
          but you been paid.
                    ARMAN
          No, Miss. Nobody paid me.
Dante takes a moment, looking at him.
                    DANTE
          THIS ISN’T FUCKING
          PAKISTAN, AR-MEE.
               (beat)
          I know these tricks. Don’t
          fuck with me.
                  ARMAN
               (laughing)
          Okay.
          (MORE)

                                                       64.


                 ARMAN (CONT’D)
               (beat)
          Can I ask, are you okay?

                  DANTE
          No. I’m not fucking okay. I’m
          fucked.


                  ARMAN
          Miss, can I say?
                  DANTE
          Am I home now?
                  ARMAN
          Where I come from, a man
          would never let a woman come
          home alone like this. Always,
          you should have a good man
          with you.
                  DANTE
               (laughing)
          R-man... where I come from, this is
          what a good man does.

 He gets out to open her door.
                  DANTE
          NO! I’ll do it.
Arman just shakes his head as she smiles and flips him
a slow bird.
She exits the cab on her own (with great difficulty)
and heads to the front door of a brownstone building
with her middle finger still extended. Her heels are
in her hand again and her legs seem to be working
less and less.
Arman watches her with concern until she enters
the building.

                                                       65.


INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF APT.
DOOR. - JUST PAST 9PM
Dante is in front of an apartment door rustling for her
KEYS in her purse. She pulls the keys back and looks
at all of them. She notices a new KEY CHAIN. It is
two, golden testicles with a mini plaque saying ’He
Who Owns the Gold Rules’. She has a brief memory of
Abe giving her these telling her she ’needs a pair’.
Dante looks up to take the moment in and smiles.
When she finally finds her key, she keeps trying the
lock and missing while longer transition scenes of
black are occurring.
When she finally gets the key part of the way in, it
doesn’t seem to fit.
Fade to black.

We hear a ’bang’ and a ’thump’ in the
dark... FADE IN
Dante is lying on her side with her eyes wide open.
One eye is quickly swelling. She is looking upward. A
trickle of blood starts trailing down her lips from
her nose.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.
