description: >-
  The camera is a witness, not a storyteller. Unpolished, immediate, and
  uncomfortably close to real life. Every frame earns its credibility.

concern_group_hints:
  look_and_feel:
    lighting_concept: >-
      Available light only — no movie lights visible or implied. Fluorescents,
      overcast sky, bare bulbs. Exposure serves the scene, not the actor.
      Occasionally under- or overexposed for authenticity.
    color_palette: >-
      Ungraded or lightly graded. Colors as they exist in the world —
      no color correction for beauty. Slightly desaturated to feel like
      video journalism. Whites may blow out; shadows may crush.
    camera_personality: >-
      Handheld, responsive, imperfect. The camera reacts to action rather
      than anticipating it. Zoom from distance rather than dolly. Rack focus
      that arrives a beat late. The operator is a human, not a machine.
    composition_philosophy: >-
      Messy, lived-in framing. Characters cut off by frame edges. Background
      action continues uncontrolled. No beauty shots — every frame is evidence.
  sound_and_music:
    ambient_environment: >-
      Location sound with all its imperfections — wind on the mic, room tone
      shifts between cuts, overlapping voices. The world is noisy and indifferent.
    emotional_soundscape: >-
      Sound design is invisible. No sweetening, no emotional manipulation through
      audio. What you hear is what was there. Silence is real silence, not
      designed absence.
    music_intent: >-
      No score, or minimal score that enters only at structural turning points.
      If music exists, it comes from the world — a radio, a phone, a street
      performer. The audience provides their own emotional soundtrack.
  rhythm_and_flow:
    pacing_intent: >-
      Real-time where possible. Long takes that hold through discomfort.
      Cuts are functional, not rhythmic — we cut because we must, not for
      energy. No slow motion. Time moves at life speed.
  character_and_performance:
    emotional_state_entering: >-
      Characters behave as if the camera isn't there. No performance — just
      behavior. Overlapping dialogue, false starts, mumbling. Physical
      fidgeting and unconscious habits.
  story_world:
    narrative_rhythm_notes: >-
      Events happen whether the camera is ready or not. No narrative
      convenience — if the protagonist misses something, so does the audience.
      Exposition comes through observation, not explanation.
