description: >-
  Light as a character. Time bends. Every gesture is a painting and every
  silence holds a universe. Beauty is the argument, not the decoration.

concern_group_hints:
  look_and_feel:
    lighting_concept: >-
      Soft, diffused, almost spiritual. Light enters from above and from
      windows. Backlit figures with halation. Lens flares as emotional
      punctuation, not accident. Magic hour stretched across entire sequences.
      Candlelight for intimacy; cold blue for isolation.
    color_palette: >-
      Muted pastels — lavender, powder blue, blush, sage. Occasional rich
      saturation in a single element — a red dress, green leaves, golden light.
      Blacks are never true black; shadows hold color.
    camera_personality: >-
      Slow, floating, weightless. Steadicam or gimbal — the camera glides
      through space like a ghost. Close-ups linger on texture: skin, fabric,
      water, light on surfaces. Occasional macro inserts — a hand, an eye,
      a flame.
    composition_philosophy: >-
      Painterly. Every frame could hang in a gallery. Symmetry for serenity,
      broken symmetry for disruption. Extreme depth of field — sharp foreground
      and background simultaneously. Reflections on water, glass, eyes.
  sound_and_music:
    ambient_environment: >-
      Natural sounds elevated to music — wind, water, breath, heartbeat.
      Room tone is warm and present. Exterior sound is vast and enveloping.
      The world hums.
    emotional_soundscape: >-
      Sound design and score blend until indistinguishable. A held violin
      note becomes wind becomes silence. Emotional transitions happen in
      the sound before they appear on screen.
    music_intent: >-
      Orchestral or solo piano, minimal and precise. Arvo Part, Max Richter,
      Ryuichi Sakamoto as reference points. Music breathes — silence between
      notes is as important as the notes themselves. Choral elements for
      moments of transcendence.
  rhythm_and_flow:
    pacing_intent: >-
      Meditative. Scenes unfold like memories — non-linear, emotionally
      ordered rather than chronologically. Long dissolves. Time-lapse as
      visual poetry. The edit breathes with the music.
  character_and_performance:
    emotional_state_entering: >-
      Characters exist in heightened emotional states expressed through
      stillness, not volume. A glance carries the weight of a monologue.
      Physical precision — every gesture is considered. Restraint is the
      dominant register; when it breaks, the effect is devastating.
  story_world:
    narrative_rhythm_notes: >-
      Structure follows emotional logic, not plot logic. Scenes connect
      through feeling, image, and motif rather than causation. The story
      asks questions rather than answering them. Memory and present
      coexist on screen.
