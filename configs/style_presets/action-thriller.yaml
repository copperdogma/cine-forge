description: >-
  Every cut is a punch. The clock is always ticking. Momentum is the story
  and stillness is the threat. The audience should forget to breathe.

concern_group_hints:
  look_and_feel:
    lighting_concept: >-
      High-key for pursuit, low-key for tension. Harsh, contrasty light
      that sculpts faces and environments. Practicals in motion — headlights,
      muzzle flash, emergency lights. No beauty light — utility and urgency.
    color_palette: >-
      Teal-and-orange blockbuster palette for action; desaturated steel-blue
      for tactical sequences. High contrast. Blacks are crushed for graphic
      impact. Color temperature shifts signal emotional terrain.
    camera_personality: >-
      Aggressive. Close, fast, reactive. Handheld during chaos — stable on
      Steadicam for power shots. Whip pans, crash zooms, POV inserts.
      The camera is a combatant, not an observer.
    composition_philosophy: >-
      Tight framing during fights — the audience feels the claustrophobia.
      Wide establishing shots only to show scale before constricting.
      Diagonal lines and tilted horizons for instability. Leading lines
      that pull the eye toward danger.
  sound_and_music:
    ambient_environment: >-
      Engines, gunfire, breaking glass, bodies hitting surfaces. Environmental
      sound is loud, present, physical. Between action beats: ringing ears,
      muffled voices, the protagonist's breathing.
    emotional_soundscape: >-
      Sound design IS the score during action — impacts have sub-bass weight,
      bullets crack and whine, glass shatters in slow-motion detail. Silence
      before the ambush. Sound returns with the first shot.
    music_intent: >-
      Percussive, driving, electronic or hybrid orchestral. Building patterns
      that accelerate with the action. Bass drops on impacts. Music cuts
      to silence at the moment of highest tension, then floods back.
      Ticking clock motif.
  rhythm_and_flow:
    pacing_intent: >-
      Relentless forward momentum. Short scenes, hard cuts, no breathing room
      during action sequences. Strategic slowdowns between set pieces to reset
      the audience — but never for long. Average shot length drops during
      climax. Cross-cutting between parallel threats.
  character_and_performance:
    emotional_state_entering: >-
      Characters under pressure reveal themselves through action, not words.
      Economy of dialogue — what they do matters more than what they say.
      Physical commitment: exhaustion, pain, fear expressed through the body.
      Stillness in a character signals danger, not calm.
  story_world:
    narrative_rhythm_notes: >-
      Escalating stakes in three acts: establish → complicate → resolve at
      full speed. Ticking clock or countdown as structural spine. Information
      revealed through action, not exposition. Set pieces are plot points
      that physically transform the story world.
