  Rain-slicked streets, moral ambiguity, and shadows that swallow the frame.

concern_group_hints:
  look_and_feel:
    lighting_concept: >-
      High contrast with deep shadows. Motivated sources — neon signs,
      streetlights, car headlights cutting through rain. Hard light with
      sharp falloff. Practical sources visible in frame.
    color_palette: >-
      Desaturated base with strategic neon pops — cyan, magenta, amber.
      Blacks are true black, not lifted. Skin tones cool and sallow.
    camera_personality: >-
      Voyeuristic, low angles, reflections in wet surfaces. Slow, deliberate
      movement. Frequent use of frames-within-frames — doorways, mirrors, windows.
    composition_philosophy: >-
      Characters isolated in frame by negative space. Deep staging with
      foreground elements creating depth. Dutch angles for psychological unease.
  sound_and_music:
    ambient_environment: >-
      Urban rain, distant sirens, fluorescent buzz, traffic through glass.
      The city never sleeps and never shuts up.
    emotional_soundscape: >-
      Tension built through layered drones and uncomfortable silence.
      Sound drops away before violence, floods back after.
    music_intent: >-
      Jazz-influenced score — sparse saxophone, brushed drums, solo piano.
      Music enters scenes late and leaves early. Source music from radios
      and bars bleeds into the emotional score.
  rhythm_and_flow:
    pacing_intent: >-
      Slow burn with sharp, sudden escalation. Long takes in conversation
      scenes; rapid cutting during confrontation. Time dilates in key moments.
  character_and_performance:
    emotional_state_entering: >-
      Characters carry exhaustion and guarded wariness. Trust is earned
      through action, never words. Emotional armor is the default state.
  story_world:
    narrative_rhythm_notes: >-
      Information revealed through misdirection. The audience and protagonist
      discover the truth at different rates. Plot twists recontextualize
      earlier scenes on rewatch.
