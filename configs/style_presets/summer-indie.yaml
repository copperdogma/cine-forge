description: >-
  Golden hour light, lived-in spaces, and conversations that meander toward truth.
  The camera hangs back and observes. Every frame feels like a memory you're not sure happened.

concern_group_hints:
  look_and_feel:
    lighting_concept: >-
      Naturalistic, available light whenever possible. Golden hour is the
      emotional anchor. Interiors lit by practicals — table lamps, TV glow,
      kitchen overheads. Soft, warm, forgiving.
    color_palette: >-
      Warm earth tones — amber, sage, faded denim blue. Slightly lifted
      blacks for a hazy, memory-like quality. Saturation varies by emotion:
      vibrant in joy, muted in melancholy.
    camera_personality: >-
      Handheld but steady — present, not intrusive. Close-ups held longer
      than comfortable. The camera stays on faces after dialogue ends.
      Occasional long lens compression for voyeuristic distance.
    composition_philosophy: >-
      Characters centered in medium shots with environmental context.
      Negative space feels like breathing room, not isolation.
      Wide shots of landscapes establish emotional geography.
  sound_and_music:
    ambient_environment: >-
      Cicadas, sprinklers, distant lawnmowers, screen doors.
      The sounds of a world that exists whether or not the story does.
    emotional_soundscape: >-
      Ambient sound carries emotion — wind picks up before hard conversations,
      birdsong returns after reconciliation. Diegetic music from car radios
      and Bluetooth speakers.
    music_intent: >-
      Indie folk or lo-fi electronic underscore. Needle drops of era-specific
      songs that the characters would actually listen to. Music as memory trigger.
  rhythm_and_flow:
    pacing_intent: >-
      Unhurried. Scenes breathe. Long takes during emotional moments.
      Time skips between scenes — the edit trusts the audience to fill gaps.
      Montage used sparingly, for passage of time rather than action.
  character_and_performance:
    emotional_state_entering: >-
      Characters are mid-thought when scenes begin. They carry the weight
      of offscreen life. Vulnerability surfaces through gestures and
      half-finished sentences, not monologues.
  story_world:
    narrative_rhythm_notes: >-
      Episodic structure — scenes feel like vignettes that accumulate meaning.
      The "plot" emerges from character decisions rather than external events.
      Ending is open, not resolved.
