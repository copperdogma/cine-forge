description: >-
  The house is alive and the walls remember. Baroque architecture, creeping dread,
  and the slow certainty that something terrible has already happened.

concern_group_hints:
  look_and_feel:
    lighting_concept: >-
      Candlelight, firelight, single-source practicals in vast dark spaces.
      Pools of warm light surrounded by impenetrable shadow. Lightning
      illuminates what you wish you hadn't seen. Day exteriors are overcast,
      grey, draining.
    color_palette: >-
      Deep burgundy, forest green, tarnished gold against charcoal and black.
      Skin tones drained of warmth. Occasional vivid red — blood, roses,
      fabric — as punctuation. Desaturated everything else.
    camera_personality: >-
      Slow, measured, predatory. Tracking shots through corridors. The camera
      moves when the character doesn't, suggesting an unseen presence.
      Extreme wide shots that dwarf the human figure. Sustained close-ups
      during moments of terror.
    composition_philosophy: >-
      Symmetry that feels wrong. Characters small in ornate, overwhelming
      spaces. Vertical lines — pillars, doorframes, staircases — create
      prison-like framing. Reflections and doubles in mirrors, windows, water.
  sound_and_music:
    ambient_environment: >-
      Creaking wood, settling foundations, wind finding gaps in old walls.
      Clock ticks amplified. Distant sounds of indeterminate origin —
      is that the house or something in it?
    emotional_soundscape: >-
      Low-frequency drones that sit below conscious hearing. Sound that makes
      the audience uneasy without knowing why. Sudden silence before the scare.
      Acoustic space feels larger than the room — cathedral reverb in a bedroom.
    music_intent: >-
      Orchestral, minor key, strings-heavy. Dissonant chords that never resolve.
      Choir voices — wordless, distant, almost liturgical. Music boxes or
      children's melodies pitched wrong. The score mourns before the tragedy.
  rhythm_and_flow:
    pacing_intent: >-
      Glacial build punctuated by sharp, violent cuts. Long, hypnotic takes
      where nothing happens — then everything happens in two seconds. The
      audience's dread does the work; the edit holds space for it to grow.
  character_and_performance:
    emotional_state_entering: >-
      Characters are already unsettled when scenes begin. Denial is the
      default emotional register — they explain away what they've seen.
      Physical containment: small movements, held breath, rigid posture
      that cracks into trembling.
  story_world:
    narrative_rhythm_notes: >-
      Past and present blur. The story reveals its secrets in layers —
      what the house shows and what it hides. Each revelation recontextualizes
      the previous. The ending has been visible from the beginning for those
      who knew where to look.
