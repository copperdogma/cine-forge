Title: The Last Signal

INT. ABANDONED CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

Banks of dead monitors line the wall. A lone green LED blinks.

MARA
(whispering)

OWEN
No one is listening anymore.

Mara flips a rusted switch. A tone hums to life.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - NIGHT

Lightning fractures the clouds over the valley.
