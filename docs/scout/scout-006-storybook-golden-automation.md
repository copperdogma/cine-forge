# Scout 006 — Storybook Golden Automation

**Source:** `/Users/cam/Documents/Projects/Storybook/storybook` (commit `a568667`)
**Scouted:** 2026-03-01
**Scope:** Commit a568667 — "Story 026: Golden fixture automation skills + structural validator"
**Previous:** Scout 005 (2026-03-01)
**Status:** Complete

## Findings

Storybook landed a complete golden fixture automation system: 4 skills, a runbook, and a self-contained structural validator. The system is explicitly designed to be portable across projects — the validator has a "SCHEMA CONFIG" section at the top, and the skills reference a project-generated README.md format spec rather than hardcoding entity types.

### Skills (domain-agnostic, minimal adaptation needed)

1. **`/setup-golden` — Bootstrap golden workspace** — HIGH value
   What: Explores the project autonomously, generates all workspace files (README format spec, `_verify-golden-outputs.md` protocol, `validate-golden.ts` validator, checklist, coverage matrix, inbox). Makes opinionated decisions about golden format based on project schemas. Supports `--refresh` for schema changes.
   Us: We have a `/setup-golden` that describes the *process* but doesn't generate workspace files. Storybook's version actually creates them.
   Recommendation: **Replace** our `/setup-golden` SKILL.md with Storybook's version. When run, it will generate CineForge-specific workspace files.

2. **`/golden-create` — Create golden from input** — HIGH value
   What: Create a golden reference from input data. Reads format spec + existing example, processes input, produces golden output files, runs validator. Key principle: "Don't aim for perfection — `/golden-verify` catches issues on subsequent passes."
   Us: No equivalent. Our setup-golden describes creating goldens but doesn't have a quick "create one golden" skill.
   Recommendation: **Adopt** as new skill, adapt file paths for CineForge.

3. **`/golden-verify` — Orchestrated adversarial verification** — HIGH value
   What: Orchestrator that launches parallel Opus subagents to verify fixtures. Reads checklist → launches subagents → collects verdicts → updates checklist → loops. Never reads fixture content (context protection). Can run overnight. Key insight: "Don't verify what you just created" — context isolation between creator and verifier.
   Us: We have `/verify-eval` for mismatch investigation but nothing for proactive golden verification.
   Recommendation: **Adopt** as new skill.

4. **`/golden-verify-reset` — Reset verification status** — MEDIUM value
   What: Reset CLEAN fixtures to PENDING for re-verification. Preserves audit trail. Useful after schema changes or before overnight runs.
   Us: No equivalent.
   Recommendation: **Adopt** as new skill.

### Infrastructure

5. **`docs/runbooks/golden-fixtures.md` — Portable runbook** — MEDIUM value
   What: Complete runbook covering tiers (T1/T2/T3), adding fixtures, promoting T2→T1, re-verification, structural validation, inbox pattern, known gotchas.
   Us: We have `docs/runbooks/golden-build.md` (Story 109, created earlier today). The Storybook runbook is more mature and covers the inbox/validator workflow we don't have yet.
   Recommendation: **Replace** `golden-build.md` with Storybook's version, adapted for CineForge paths. The old one predates the automation tooling.

6. **Structural validator (`validate-golden.ts`)** — HIGH value (generated by `/setup-golden`)
   What: 798-line self-contained TS script. Schema config as plain data at top. Validates: ref consistency, required fields, metadata counts, enum compliance, orphan detection, cross-fixture coverage gaps. Runs as `npx tsx validate-golden.ts [fixture-id]`.
   Us: No structural validator. All golden quality is manual review only.
   Recommendation: **Will be generated** when `/setup-golden` runs. Not a separate adoption item.

7. **Inbox pattern (`_inbox/`)** — MEDIUM value (generated by `/setup-golden`)
   What: Drop-zone for new inputs. `/golden-verify` auto-processes them via `/golden-create`.
   Us: No equivalent.
   Recommendation: **Will be generated** when `/setup-golden` runs.

## Approved

- [x] 1. Replace `/setup-golden` SKILL.md — `.agents/skills/setup-golden/SKILL.md` replaced with bootstrapping version
- [x] 2. Create `/golden-create` skill — `.agents/skills/golden-create/SKILL.md` created
- [x] 3. Create `/golden-verify` skill — `.agents/skills/golden-verify/SKILL.md` created
- [x] 4. Create `/golden-verify-reset` skill — `.agents/skills/golden-verify-reset/SKILL.md` created
- [x] 5. Replace `docs/runbooks/golden-build.md` — replaced with portable golden fixtures pattern

All skills synced (34 total). Gemini TOML wrappers generated for all 3 new skills.

## Skipped / Rejected

- 6. `validate-golden.ts` — Generated by `/setup-golden`, not adopted directly
- 7. Inbox pattern — Generated by `/setup-golden`, not adopted directly
