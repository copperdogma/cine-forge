# 1. Complete Element Inventory  

- **Key findings:**  A finished film requires dozens of creative choices beyond the screenplay.  Broad categories include **pre-production** (look development: overall visual style, color palette, costume/character design, set/location design, prop design, sound style or score style), **per-scene interpretation** (lighting setup and mood, camera composition and movements, shot coverage, pacing and editing rhythm, scene transitions, ambient sound, music cues, blocking of actors, actor emotional tone/performance direction, set dressing, practical effects), **per-shot technical details** (framing/shot type, camera angle, lens/focal length choice, camera movement, depth-of-field, shot duration), **post-production** (color grading and final tone, visual effects and enhancements, sound editing/mixing, Foley, ADR, music scoring, titles/credits, aspect ratio, compression), and **ongoing cross-cutting concerns** (continuity of costumes/injuries/props across scenes, consistent character look/behavior, visual and audio motifs, story-wide pacing and theme rhythm).  For each element we note scope and user familiarity: e.g. *lighting* (scene-level; novices think “bright vs dark” ([darkskiesfilm.com](https://darkskiesfilm.com/what-to-include-in-a-look-book-for-film/#:~:text=H3%20Lighting)); if left to AI it tends toward generic even illumination), *color palette* (project or act-level; novices recognize “warm/cold/vibrant” tones; AI-guessed palettes often lack thematic coherence), *costume design* (character-level; novices care somewhat about what characters wear; AI picks stock outfits that may not fit the story), *camera framing/angle* (per-shot; novices know “wide vs close-up” but not more; AI picks mediocre framing without storytelling insight ([www.studiobinder.com](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-shot-list-example/#:~:text=%2A%20Brief%20description%20of%20shot,audio%20notes%2C%20or%20prop%20mentions))), *camera movement* (per-shot; novices may say “handheld vs static”; AI tends to use subtle cuts or fixed shots unless prompted), *performance/emotion* (scene; novices can describe “happy/angry” but rarely subtleties; an unsupervised AI performance will sound flat or stereotyped), *blocking* (scene; novices seldom articulate; AI-naïve staging often looks random or unnatural ([medium.com](https://medium.com/the-movie-geek/understanding-cinematography-blocking-a-shot-b6f571501a1a#:~:text=,room%2C%20a%20local%20park%2C%20a)) ([medium.com](https://medium.com/the-movie-geek/understanding-cinematography-blocking-a-shot-b6f571501a1a#:~:text=match%20at%20L132%20blocking%20a,your%20actors%20will%20be%20doing))), *sound design* (scene/post; novices rarely specify beyond “loud/quiet music”; an AI mix with no guidance is often generic or unbalanced ([filmdaft.com](https://filmdaft.com/what-is-sound-design-in-film-definition/#:~:text=Sound%20design%20in%20film%20is,rhythm%2C%20and%20point%20of%20view))), *music style* (scene or project; novices might request “epic/fun/jazzy”; AI will commonly fallback to stock brassy/piano cues), *pacing* (scene/story; novices say “fast/slow editing”; AI will use default cut lengths that may not match desired energy), *transitions* (scene; novices either want “cuts” or effects like fade; AI picks simple cuts by default), *visual effects* (post; novices rarely request specifics; AI if unaided adds minimal or no VFX), *color grading* (post; novices say “warm” or “bleak” moods; AI’s automatic grading may appear flat or mismatched). 

  For each element we note where it lives and how a layperson perceives it. For example, **lighting** is chosen per scene by the cinematographer; non-filmmakers might only think “bright vs dark, warm vs cool”. If AI sets lighting alone, scenes often look evenly lit or arbitrarily lit (losing mood). **Camera framing/angle** operates per shot; novices think “close-up or wide shot” or “up-angle/low-angle” only loosely. Left to AI, framed shots will often lack variety or clarity of focus. **Performance/emotion** is given per character/scene; lay users might say “make it more dramatic” or “happier”, but if fully AI-driven, dialogue delivery and expressions come out flat or cartoonish. **Sound design** spans all scenes – dialogue, ambience, SFX, music – but novices think in broad terms (“quiet background” vs “music”). AI-only sound may have correct words but unbalanced mixes or wrong ambient textures ([filmdaft.com](https://filmdaft.com/what-is-sound-design-in-film-definition/#:~:text=Sound%20design%20in%20film%20is,rhythm%2C%20and%20point%20of%20view)). **Editing pace** is per scene/act; novices use terms like “fast cuts/slow cuts” but if AI edits without direction, pacing tends toward a generic middle (neither snappy nor lyrical). **Color grading** (post) shapes the final tone; novices might request “cooler/warmer” color mood, but AI auto-grading is often neutral or erratic. 

- **Recommended approach:**  Provide explicit UI controls or “readiness” markers for *each* category above. Organize the inventory in layers (e.g. global style vs scene vs shot) so users can specify key choices. For example, let the user set a **project-wide style** (e.g. “cyberpunk neon look”, “documentary realism”, “childlike animated style”) which then biases color palette, visual texture, and sound profile consistently. At the **scene level**, expose mood words (e.g. “tense, romantic, surreal”), lighting suggestions (“backlit, low-key, high contrast”), camera ideas (“steady close-ups, dynamic moving shots”), and audio cues (“ominous ambient vs tranquil nature sounds, music genre”). At the **shot level**, allow framing/lens/motion hints if needed (though novices may not use this). And always show readiness states (red/yellow/green) so users know what’s specified. This ensures every element (lighting, camera, costumes, etc.) can be explicitly defined or left to AI if the user chooses. Encourage users to describe *what they want to feel or see* (e.g. “golden dusk lighting”, “cluttered messy desk” (set-dressing), “sci-fi synth music”, “slow calm pace”) to cover these categories in natural language.

- **Runner-up:**  A slightly narrower method would be to focus only on **scene-level aesthetic groups** (visual vs audio vs narrative). For example, have one section for _Visual Style_ (including lighting, color, camera), one for _Audio Style_ (ambient, effects, music), and one for _Editing/Mood_ (transitions, pace, tone). This simplifies the inventory but still lets users touch most categories. It is more approachable than pure departmental groupings, though still somewhat abstract.

- **Avoid:**  Simply trusting AI to improvise everything (red-level for all elements) leads to generic or incoherent films. Also avoid organizing controls strictly by film crew department labels (“Cinematography”, “Sound”, “Editing”), since non-experts think in terms of scene mood and visuals rather than crew roles. (For example, users don’t typically ask for input in “costume design” terms, they say “make him look rough/noir”, which spans wardrobe and lighting.) Finally, do not omit obvious elements like color grading or sound effects – each perceptible attribute should have a toggle.  

- **Evidence:**  Storyboard/lookbook practice shows filmmakers separate visual elements into lighting, color, framing, camera movement, costume, etc. ([darkskiesfilm.com](https://darkskiesfilm.com/what-to-include-in-a-look-book-for-film/#:~:text=H3%20Lighting)) ([darkskiesfilm.com](https://darkskiesfilm.com/what-to-include-in-a-look-book-for-film/#:~:text=H3%20Camera%20Movement)). Script breakdown sheets split casts, props, vehicles, etc. by scene ([www.studiobinder.com](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-mastering-script-breakdown-elements/#:~:text=Script%20Breakdown%20Categories)). Shot lists explicitly track shot type, angle, movement, and equipment ([www.studiobinder.com](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-shot-list-example/#:~:text=%2A%20Brief%20description%20of%20shot,audio%20notes%2C%20or%20prop%20mentions)). Sound design theory identifies dialogue, ambiance, SFX, music as layered elements ([filmdaft.com](https://filmdaft.com/what-is-sound-design-in-film-definition/#:~:text=Sound%20design%20in%20film%20is,rhythm%2C%20and%20point%20of%20view)). These industry frameworks confirm the exhaustive list above and guide how to present them to users. 

# 2. Existing AI Film/Video Tools  

- **Key findings:**  Current AI filmmaking tools vary in how they expose control domains. **LTX Studio (Lightricks)** presents a script-to-storyboard pipeline. Users can upload a script/prompt and LTX breaks it into scenes. In each scene the UI allows setting *aspect ratio, genre visual “style” (noir, sci-fi, etc.), and mood keywords (tense, mysterious, etc.)* ([www.dupple.com](https://www.dupple.com/tools/ltx-studio#:~:text=Before%20committing%20frames%2C%20you%20can,them%20in%20every%20generated%20shot)). It auto-generates thumbnail frames (storyboard) and lets you adjust *character profiles* (age, ethnicity, outfit) once for consistency ([www.dupple.com](https://www.dupple.com/tools/ltx-studio#:~:text=Character%20Casting%20%26%20Consistency)). LTX’s shot editor adds granular camera control (keyframe camera moves, preset motion intensities) ([www.dupple.com](https://www.dupple.com/tools/ltx-studio#:~:text=Shot%20Editor%20and%20Camera%20Control)) and scene settings like weather effects. Users praise its fast storyboard generation, character consistency, and professional-style camera control ([www.dupple.com](https://www.dupple.com/tools/ltx-studio#:~:text=Shot%20Editor%20and%20Camera%20Control)) ([www.dupple.com](https://www.dupple.com/tools/ltx-studio#:~:text=Granular%20camera%20and%20shot%20control,viz%20tools)); critics note some failure cases (e.g. photorealism glitches on complex shots). Control grouping: LTX roughly splits by storyboard generator, shot editor, style controls, and timeline editor – a hybrid of **scene-level visual controls** plus **global style/presets**. 

  **Runway Gen-4** (2025) focuses on text+image prompts. Its UI places emphasis on *prompt-based controls with optional references*. Users can toggle “References” panel to drop in images (for character, style, or environment consistency) ([help.runwayml.com](https://help.runwayml.com/hc/en-us/articles/40042718905875-Creating-with-Gen-4-Image-References#:~:text=Begin%20by%20clicking%C2%A0Generate%20Image%C2%A0within%20your,Image)) and sketch compositions for layout ([help.runwayml.com](https://help.runwayml.com/hc/en-us/articles/40042718905875-Creating-with-Gen-4-Image-References#:~:text=Creating%20a%20Sketch%20Reference)). Beyond text prompt, users indirectly control visual style by whose reference; also optional choices like presets or parameters (e.g. LoRA models, though not on UI). For video (Runway Gen-4 video), the TechRadar review notes users can specify camera moves (dolly, pan, tilt) in the prompt ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools#:~:text=%5BImage%2063%3A%20Runway%20Gen,blend%20generated%20content%20right%20into)). The interface stays mostly prompt-based; there is no high-level “scene builder” UI aside from reference images. Users praise Runway for *cinematic camera control and quality visuals* ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools#:~:text=%5BImage%2063%3A%20Runway%20Gen,blend%20generated%20content%20right%20into)) but complain about unstable rendering (quick action causes jitter ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools#:~:text=sometimes%20appear%20a%20bit%20jittery,public%20figures%20or%20unauthorized%20voices))). So Runway partitions controls into “Text prompt + Up to 3 image references + (for video) camera/motion in text + optional voice/lip-sync in text”. 

  **Kling 3.0 (Kuaishou)** is a text-to-video “AI Director” with built-in multi-shot editing. Its interface asks “Describe your video” and lets you select number of shots (2–6) and aspect ratio before generation ([www.creatok.ai](https://www.creatok.ai/kling-3#:~:text=Describe%20your%20video)). The breakthrough is the multi-shot mode: it can auto-split a narrative prompt into up to 6 cuts or allow manual editing of each shot’s *duration, framing, camera movement, and perspective* ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40chris930325/kling-3-0-complete-guide-features-pricing-honest-review-b417d3a0122b#:~:text=Multi)). Characters remain consistent via uploaded references ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40chris930325/kling-3-0-complete-guide-features-pricing-honest-review-b417d3a0122b#:~:text=Character%20Consistency%20)). Users control many elements in two modes: an “auto-storyboard” or a “custom storyboard” mode where each shot’s parameters are edited. Audio is generated in-stream (dialogue, SFX, music, lip-sync) based on script prompts ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40chris930325/kling-3-0-complete-guide-features-pricing-honest-review-b417d3a0122b#:~:text=Integrated%20Audio%20Generation)). Users laud Kling’s *4K multi-shot and cinematic fidelity* ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40chris930325/kling-3-0-complete-guide-features-pricing-honest-review-b417d3a0122b#:~:text=But%20spec%20sheets%20don%E2%80%99t%20tell,0)), but note audio issues and instability (some renders fail) ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40chris930325/kling-3-0-complete-guide-features-pricing-honest-review-b417d3a0122b#:~:text=,ready)). The UI groups by shot sequence – e.g. a panel per shot with shot-editing controls – and by **input prompt vs. reference images**. 

  **Pika Labs (Pika 2.1, 2025)** is pure text-to-video. The UI is simpler: users pick a model version (1.5/2.0/2.1) and enter a text prompt (including aspects like subject, motion, environment, emotion) ([pikartai.com](https://pikartai.com/pika-labs-ai-text-to-video/#:~:text=,Style%3A%20Cinematic%2C%20fantasy)). Options let users choose aspect ratio and video length; there is an optional field for a **voice line** to lip-sync ([pikartai.com](https://pikartai.com/pika-labs-ai-text-to-video/#:~:text=%23%205.%20Beta%20Lip,Voice%20Line%20Support)) ([pikartai.com](https://pikartai.com/pika-labs-ai-text-to-video/#:~:text=Getting%20Started%20with%20Pika%20AI,Video)). Pika emphasizes controls via prompt phrasing: for example, adding “a tracking shot of…” or “at sunset” directs camera and lighting style ([pikartai.com](https://pikartai.com/pika-labs-ai-text-to-video/#:~:text=)) ([pikartai.com](https://pikartai.com/pika-labs-ai-text-to-video/#:~:text=Here%20are%20some%20prompt%20styles,that%20yield%20impressive%20results)). They also tout scene chaining – writing a multi-part prompt to create multiple scenes in sequence ([pikartai.com](https://pikartai.com/pika-labs-ai-text-to-video/#:~:text=)). Creative parameters exposed: camera motion by text, scene transitions by chaining prompts, character consistency (Pika 2.1 boasts rare ability to hold a character’s look across scenes) ([pikartai.com](https://pikartai.com/pika-labs-ai-text-to-video/#:~:text=,Consistency)), and beta lip-sync by providing dialogue. The grouping is essentially “scene text prompt plus global settings” – there is no hierarchical UI beyond the prompt box and settings panel. Users generally say Pika “just works” for short clips, but have limited control beyond prompt detail (i.e. missing a storyboard or timeline metaphor).  

  **Sora (OpenAI)** is cracked into the ChatGPT/Gemini UI. On Sora’s interface (via the Chat or dedicated app), the user enters a text prompt and then uses UI controls for **duration and size** ([platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/video-generation/#:~:text=Start%20by%20calling%20,the%20video%27s%20resolution%20and%20length)) ([help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12460853-creating-videos-with-sora#:~:text=How%20to%20set%20duration%3A)). The model draws from a “Video API” so users can also supply reference images or transcripts, but the public UI is essentially a prompt box plus settings (see Sora API doc). Sora 2 prompts emphasize shot description (type, subject, setting, lighting, motion) ([platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/video-generation/#:~:text=Start%20by%20calling%20,the%20video%27s%20resolution%20and%20length)). The ChatGPT UI has a “duration” dropdown and lets users pick aspect ratio or orientation through a settings gear ([help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12460853-creating-videos-with-sora#:~:text=How%20to%20set%20duration%3A)). There is no scene-by-scene storyboard; multicuts must be prompted with narrative language. Sora’s controls are therefore **text plus high-level settings**. By reports, users appreciate Sora’s speed and coherence but note guardrails (“no realistic people, no copyright” etc.) ([platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/video-generation/#:~:text=Guardrails%20and%20restrictions)). Creative control is all prompt-driven: users can say “two friends chatting with natural cafe audio” to generate dialogue ([help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12460853-creating-videos-with-sora#:~:text=,dialogue)). 

  **Saga AI** (Cyberfilm.ai, 2025) combines script/storyboard and editing. Its pitch mentions entrée points: “<script> → scenes/storyboards → edit”. While detailed docs are scarce, Saga reportedly uses Sora 2 and Google’s Veo 3.1 under the hood. In Saga you can write scenes or scripts, generate storyboards, then drag them onto a timeline and edit. Controls likely include mood/style tags on storyboards, plus conventional editing tools. Users praise Saga’s integrated workflow (besides newness); complaints are not yet recorded publicly. Structurally, Saga organizes by **script and sequence**: each scene has AI-generated panels, and editing is like a NLE (cuts, trim). 

  **Veo 3 (Google)** is accessed via the Gemini AI app or Google API. In Gemini’s “Video” mode, users can either start from text or use “Ingredients to Video” (photo reference) to set style ([www.androidcentral.com](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-making-it-easier-for-gemini-app-users-to-generate-videos-from-photos#:~:text=The%20feature%20is%20called%20,It%20appears%20in%20the%20Gemini)). The controls in Gemini/Veo are: a prompt field, optional image upload for “character/object/style” reference, and dropdowns for length/format. In October 2025 Google added “Ingredients” so users can upload one or more images that Veo 3.1 will use to lock style/objects ([www.androidcentral.com](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-making-it-easier-for-gemini-app-users-to-generate-videos-from-photos#:~:text=The%20feature%20is%20called%20,It%20appears%20in%20the%20Gemini)). For example, uploading a portrait can make the same “character” appear. Otherwise, Veo is largely prompt-driven like Sora. Users appreciate Veo 3.1’s realism and audio control, but find it more restrictive than Sora (Gemini trades detail for safety) ([www.androidcentral.com](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-making-it-easier-for-gemini-app-users-to-generate-videos-from-photos#:~:text=Ingredients%20to%20Video%20is%20designed,and%20Google%20AI%20Ultra%20subscribers)). The UI grouping is minimal: a single video-generation pane with prompt and attachments (no shot editor or timeline). 

- **Recommended approach:**  Build on models like LTX and Kling by giving users per-scene/storyboard control plus reference-based locking. For each generated scene, surface controls for **visual style (genre/mood, color grading presets, lighting vignette), characters (appearance, outfits via reference images)**, and **camera** (preset moves or a simple “camera shake vs static” toggle). Allow prompt modifiers in natural language (as in Runway/Sora/Pika) for fine-grained detail. Importantly, incorporate a storyboard/timeline view (as Saga and LTX do) so users see shots and can adjust coverage and pacing. Organize these controls in an intuitive panel (not hidden in JSON), grouping scene-level vision settings together and listing shot-level parameters in a strip. Also include an audio section (like Sora’s transcript or Kling’s speaker tags) for dialogue and sound cues. 

- **Runner-up:**  A simpler UI could be “script prompt → single shot” as some text-video tools do, supplemented by a slide-in panel of **adjustable sliders** for “camera distance (wide/medium/close)”, “angle (high/eye/low)”, “lighting (bright/moody)”, “music intensity” etc. This lets novices tweak common concerns. It’s less precise than LTX or Kling (“tell, don’t pick from dozens of sliders”), but easier to grasp. Think of it like Instagram filters but for scenes. 

- **Avoid:**  Don’t silo creative options behind confusing labels or many nested tabs. For example, LTX hides “mood” under genre styling which some users overlook; better to let users type “make it X” directly. Also avoid only text prompt input with no UI feedback – people praised Saga’s clarity versus pure terminal. And avoid requiring users to pre-break their script into shots manually (unless they want to). Automatic scene division is useful; manual shot-blocking could come later. 

- **Evidence:**  The LTX review highlights that users value *mood and style presets, character profiles, and a visual storyboard/timeline* ([www.dupple.com](https://www.dupple.com/tools/ltx-studio#:~:text=Before%20committing%20frames%2C%20you%20can,them%20in%20every%20generated%20shot)) ([www.dupple.com](https://www.dupple.com/tools/ltx-studio#:~:text=Color%20grading%20presets%2C%20lighting%20mood,depth%20without%20requiring%20VFX%20expertise)). Runway’s popularity comes from its flexible reference-image control and cinematic output ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools#:~:text=%5BImage%2063%3A%20Runway%20Gen,blend%20generated%20content%20right%20into)). Kling’s success is built on its multi-shot editing interface and shot-level toggles ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40chris930325/kling-3-0-complete-guide-features-pricing-honest-review-b417d3a0122b#:~:text=Multi)). Saga’s positioning emphasizes “first AI storyboard app… film sets” ([writeonsaga.com](https://writeonsaga.com/storyboard#:~:text=)), showing that UI built like storyboard-to-edit is accepted by filmmakers. These examples confirm that exposing scene/story-level controls (with visual previews) is the norm and appreciated in existing tools. 

# 3. Professional Pre-Production Organization  

- **Key findings:**  In real filmmaking, planning docs are **a mix of by-department breakdowns and by-concept vision tools**. A **script breakdown sheet** (for the 2nd AD/production manager) catalogs every element scene-by-scene: cast, props, wardrobe, special equipment, stunts, etc. ([www.studiobinder.com](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-mastering-script-breakdown-elements/#:~:text=Script%20Breakdown%20Categories)). It is organized by production categories (Cast, Extras, Props, Vehicles, etc.) with color-coded tags. A **shooting breakdown** groups logistics by department (sound, light, make-up calls on what’s needed).  By contrast, a **director’s lookbook or moodboard** organizes the visual *ideas* by theme: high-level aesthetic, color scheme, lighting style, and example images ([darkskiesfilm.com](https://darkskiesfilm.com/what-to-include-in-a-look-book-for-film/#:~:text=This%20section%20provides%20a%20broad,lighting%20styles%2C%20and%20camera%20movement)) ([darkskiesfilm.com](https://darkskiesfilm.com/what-to-include-in-a-look-book-for-film/#:~:text=H3%20Lighting)). For example, [60] shows a lookbook listing **Color Palette**, **Lighting**, **Composition/Framing**, **Camera Movement**, **Costume/Character References**, **Production Design**, and *certain scenes illustrated* ([darkskiesfilm.com](https://darkskiesfilm.com/what-to-include-in-a-look-book-for-film/#:~:text=H3%20Lighting)) ([darkskiesfilm.com](https://darkskiesfilm.com/what-to-include-in-a-look-book-for-film/#:~:text=H3%20Camera%20Movement)). A **shot list** (often created with the DP) enumerates each planned take/angle with details: shot number, camera type (wide, close, etc.), angle, movement, and maybe a staging note ([www.studiobinder.com](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-shot-list-example/#:~:text=%2A%20Brief%20description%20of%20shot,audio%20notes%2C%20or%20prop%20mentions)). A **sound design “temp” or “sound map” doc** will list dialogue lines (or transcripts), planned sound effects per action, foley needs, and music cues – i.e. dialogue, ambiences, SFX, music layers (see [53]). A **call sheet** (for the crew) includes schedule info (scene numbers, call times, locations) but also often a *brief scene description* so departments understand at a glance (e.g. “INT. BAR – Night – Frank enters, tense conversation” with key notes). A **director’s treatment or statement** lays out tone and themes in prose, and may include selective images or references (e.g. “we want an intimate, handheld look; aim for moody, warm late-evening lighting, reminiscent of early Scorsese” – not grouped by department but by mood/emotion). 

  The upshot: before shooting, departments receive both *structured lists* (breakdowns by department) and *conceptual guides* (moodboards, storyboards, notes) organized by creative intent. Directors and cinematographers talk about scenes in terms of mood and visual tone, not “I’ll email Lighting with a spec sheet.” For instance, the lookbook suggests **lighting, color, framing, camera moves** as interconnected decisions ([darkskiesfilm.com](https://darkskiesfilm.com/what-to-include-in-a-look-book-for-film/#:~:text=H3%20Lighting)), and a creative brief will prompt “how do we want audience to feel?” ([genero.com](https://genero.com/insights/mastering-the-art-of-creative-briefs#:~:text=This%20sounds%20simple%20but%20it,particular%20emotion%20we%20want%20to)) (which in turn drives choices in every dept). Continuity logs remind costume/props to keep items consistent across cuts. 

- **Recommended approach:**  Emulate the director’s perspective by grouping elements into *creative intents* – e.g. a “Look & Feel” section (lighting, color palette, camera style, costume/hair/makeup style, production design motif), *“Sound & Music”* (genres of music, kinds of ambient sounds, dynamic usage, silence), *“Rhythm & Flow”* (pacing, shot transitions, overall editing style), and *“Character & Performance”* (emotional tone for each character, subtext, motivational notes). Basically, follow a treatment/lookbook structure (what [60] describes) for vision and a shot list structure for technical detail. For iteration, allow the director/user to say “I want this scene darker and tenser” and have that adjust both lighting/color (Look & Feel) and music/acting directions (Character & Performance). Report and visualize continuity notes globally (e.g. “Frank’s coat is muddy from scene 1, ensure continuity in scene 5”). 

- **Runner-up:**  A compromise is to keep the breakdown by scope: have a **project-wide style** section (overall visual and sonic style guide, key motifs, aspect ratio, character schemes), a **scene-level** section (lighting mood, camera setup, ambient sound, performance notes per scene), and a **shot-level** section (framing, angle, lens, movement). This loosely matches industry divisions between project design/lookbook and scene shotlists. It’s more hierarchical than the pure “creative intent” grouping, but it still reflects how pre-production is often documented (storyboard then shotlist). 

- **Avoid:**  Organizing solely by crew role (Visual, Sound, Editorial, Performance) as currently done is not how directors frame things to creatives. As Genero’s brief instruction notes, filmmakers think in terms of feeling and storytelling, then use technical elements as tools ([genero.com](https://genero.com/insights/mastering-the-art-of-creative-briefs#:~:text=This%20sounds%20simple%20but%20it,particular%20emotion%20we%20want%20to)). For example, saying “darker and tenser” spans lighting *and* acting, so separating those into different UI tabs makes cross-talk hard. Also avoid abstract categories that novices won’t use (e.g. “narrative beat pacing” vs “emotional acid test”). Instead, either group by what users perceive (see next section) or by clear creative concerns. 

- **Evidence:**  Filmmaking guides and tools back this up. StudioBinder’s breakdown categories list things like Cast, Props, Stunts (i.e. Dept-based) ([www.studiobinder.com](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-mastering-script-breakdown-elements/#:~:text=Script%20Breakdown%20Categories)), but their storyboard/mood examples focus on color and lighting.  The look book breakdown in [60] explicitly sorts lighting, color, costume, etc., by conceptual sections. Shot list templates list shot type, angle, movement ([www.studiobinder.com](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-shot-list-example/#:~:text=%2A%20Brief%20description%20of%20shot,audio%20notes%2C%20or%20prop%20mentions)), showing technical needs. And creative brief advice emphasizes “how do we want the audience to feel?” which shapes every department ([genero.com](https://genero.com/insights/mastering-the-art-of-creative-briefs#:~:text=This%20sounds%20simple%20but%20it,particular%20emotion%20we%20want%20to)). These point to **grouping by story/mood and technical execution**, not purely by separate crews. 

# 4. User Mental Models for Creative Description  

- **Key findings:**  Non-specialists describe desired video style in **sensory and emotional terms**, often with pop-culture references, not technical jargon. UX of consumer video tools suggests people first think “Look” or “Emotion”. For example, TikTok and CapCut present filters labeled with feelings or aesthetics (“Dreamy”, “Vibrant”, “Moody”). Users say things like “make it warm and nostalgic” or “feel like an action movie” rather than “use a 50mm lens with 2.8 aperture”. Tools like iMovie or Canva Video have presets like “Action”, “Romantic” or simple sliders for brightness/saturation. Importantly, advertising creative briefs instruct users to “describe how you want the audience to feel” – e.g. happy, tense, rebellious ([genero.com](https://genero.com/insights/mastering-the-art-of-creative-briefs#:~:text=This%20sounds%20simple%20but%20it,particular%20emotion%20we%20want%20to)) – steering them toward emotional tone first. Novices also use **reference analogies**: “like *Blade Runner*” (cyberpunk neon style) or “like a vlog on YouTube” (handheld, quick cuts). In pitch decks and meeting notes, language is: “This scene should look dour” (affect), “play on the coffee shop from *Friends*” (familiar example), or “add suspenseful music here, make the colors colder.” Thus, natural groupings are by *What you see* vs *what you hear* vs *how it feels/moves*. 

- **Recommended approach:**  Structure the UI in **everyday vocabulary categories**, echoing how novices speak. For example: **“Visual Style”** (with sub-areas for lighting mood, color tint, “camera vibes”: e.g. “smooth vs shaky”), **“Audio Mood”** (with toggles like “add music? – genre suggestions, ambient level”), **“Pace & Flow”** (“fast/slow cut, transitions like fade/flash” described in plain terms), and **“Emotion & Tone”** (“tense, joyful, romantic – how should characters feel?”). Also allow **reference inputs** (image or video) because users often say “like this picture/scene”. This mirrors how TikTok effects or creative briefs work. Let users mix visual filters (“dark noir look”) with mood words (“make it ominous”) – bridging sensory and emotional terms. 

- **Runner-up:**  A simpler grouping is **“What You See” vs “What You Hear” vs “Story/Emotion”**. For example, *What You See* would cover lighting, color, camera (in lay terms), *What You Hear* covers sound effects and music style, and *Story* or *Emotion* covers pacing and character feelings. This lines up with how trailers and video apps often present options. It’s slightly less granular but intuitive: novices understand “controlling what you see/hear” easily (and can add “extras” like transitions). 

- **Avoid:**  Avoid using film-school terms alone. Terms like “diegetic sound”, “low-key lighting”, “master shot” mean little to casual users. Also avoid overly technical menus (“Set camera gobo, f-stop = 5.6”; “FPS vs shutter speed” – these confuse rather than help). Instead, when needed, translate technical parameters into plain language (“brighter/dimmer”, “camera shake on/off”). Another pitfall is grouping by crew (“Sound Designer”). Users don’t think “let me talk to the sound designer now”; they think in senses and vibes. 

- **Evidence:**  Creative briefs in advertising explicitly focus on desired emotional effect ([genero.com](https://genero.com/insights/mastering-the-art-of-creative-briefs#:~:text=This%20sounds%20simple%20but%20it,particular%20emotion%20we%20want%20to)). Consumer video apps categorize by mood or sensory attributes (even CapCut’s website shows templates like “emotions filter” or “mood filter” ([pippit.capcut.com](https://pippit.capcut.com/templates/emotion-filter#:~:text=emotions%20filter%20,avatar%2049%20results%20found%20for))). Educational materials “film 101” teach beginners about mood/themes first, then camera as an afterthought. These all suggest people naturally use **sensory/emotional vocabulary**.  

# 5. Key Element Dependencies  

- **Key findings:**  Many elements affect or constrain others. Examples: 
  - **Lighting ↔ Color Palette:** The color of light (warm tungsten vs cool daylight) dictates how set colors appear. A scene lit “golden hour” demands a compatible color scheme for actors and set. You wouldn’t use a red palette under green light, for instance. Thus lighting settings and color grading are tightly linked (Goldberg, 2025 emphasis).
  - **Lighting & Atmosphere ↔ Emotion:** Lighting choices set mood (harsh shadows = tension, soft diffused = calm). This in turn influences actor performances and music. (E.g. Genero advises using “lighting to convey emotion” ([genero.com](https://genero.com/insights/mastering-the-art-of-creative-briefs#:~:text=This%20sounds%20simple%20but%20it,particular%20emotion%20we%20want%20to)).)
  - **Blocking ↔ Camera Work:** Where actors stand and move (blocking) determines what camera angles and moves are possible or needed. If all the action is at one end of the room, wide shots will differ from a scene where actors move freely. You can’t plan a dolly shot if the blocking is static, and conversely you pair complex blocking with tracking shots ([medium.com](https://medium.com/the-movie-geek/understanding-cinematography-blocking-a-shot-b6f571501a1a#:~:text=match%20at%20L132%20blocking%20a,your%20actors%20will%20be%20doing)).
  - **Shot Duration ↔ Pacing:** Overall pacing (fast-paced montage vs slow drama) translates directly into shot lengths and transitions. A “tense, high-energy” scene will demand lots of quick cuts (multiple short shots), whereas a dreamy scene favors long takes. 
  - **Ambient Sound ↔ Music Choice:** The ambient environment (street noise vs silence) affects how loud or what style of music works in mixing. A cinematic score stands out more in quiet; in noisy action scenes, music must compete or adapt. 
  - **Actor Performance ↔ Editing:** If actors deliver lines very quickly or sluggishly, the editor must change cut rhythm. Performance energy and editing rhythm go hand in hand.
  - **Props/Set ↔ Color/Lighting:** Prop colors and textures can produce unwanted reflections under certain lighting, so the art department and DOP coordinate. (E.g., bright chrome props require adjusted lighting or camera angles.)
  - **Sound Effects ↔ Visuals:** When a CGI effect is added (say an explosion), sound resources must match; you can’t have silent fire. So VFX decisions drive sound design (and vice versa for impact).
  - **Cross-scene Continuity ↔ All:** Keeping elements (costumes, injuries, environmental conditions) consistent across shots is a dependency: if an actor’s wound is bleeding in Scene 2, editing from Scene 1 must show the same. This means costume and makeup (and prop placement) must be tracked globally. 

- **Recommended approach:**  Recognize and present coupled elements together. For example, link **Lighting and Color** controls in one panel; changing “overall contrast” or “warmth” should adjust both together. Pair **Blocking and Camera** controls (e.g. specify “dueling dancers, track left to right”), since most users giving a camera command implicitly define blocking. For pacing: allow editing changes (speed up/pause scene) to auto-adjust likely music tempo or cutting. Maybe warn “increased pacing!” to suggest shift to a more urgent score. In UI, shading or arrow icons could indicate that altering one thing (like lighting mood) will cover associated fields (color palette sliders, preset filters). 

- **Evidence:**  Industry guides show these links. For instance, [83] notes that *lighting, camera moves, and color correction are all tools to elicit an emotion* ([genero.com](https://genero.com/insights/mastering-the-art-of-creative-briefs#:~:text=This%20sounds%20simple%20but%20it,particular%20emotion%20we%20want%20to)) – implying you don’t tune lighting without considering its effect on color/mood. The cinematography blocking guide states that blocking decisions include “where your lights will be, what your camera will do, and what your actors will do” ([medium.com](https://medium.com/the-movie-geek/understanding-cinematography-blocking-a-shot-b6f571501a1a#:~:text=match%20at%20L132%20blocking%20a,your%20actors%20will%20be%20doing)), showing lighting, camera, and blocking are planned as one step. Film sound design layers (dialogue, ambient, music) are interdependent ([filmdaft.com](https://filmdaft.com/what-is-sound-design-in-film-definition/#:~:text=Sound%20design%20in%20film%20is,rhythm%2C%20and%20point%20of%20view)). These confirm that many creative elements are inherently linked and should not be specified in isolation. 

# 6. Grouping Schemes Evaluation  

We evaluated four possible UI groupings:

- **Option A – By Professional Role (Editorial / Visual / Sound / Performance):**  *Intuition:* Film crew roles align to real production teams, but lay users don’t naturally think in these buckets. “Editorial” or “Visual” are abstract to novices. *Cross-requests:* A request like “make it darker and tenser” splits across Visual (darker lighting) **and** Performance/Emotion (tenser acting), forcing the user to tab-switch. *Beginners vs Experts:* Experts might understand “I tweak the Visual tab for lighting/color and Performance tab for mood.” Beginners likely wouldn’t know which tab covers “scene mood” or “character vibe”. *AI mapping:* Parts align (editorial → cut/pacing, visual → camera/color, sound, etc.), so it’s machine-friendly, but not how users speak. *Verdict:* This is the **least intuitive** for general users and packs unrelated concepts (music vs editing both under “Sound/Editorial”). It also breaks requests that span mood across roles. Use only if targeting technically trained filmmakers who already think in departments, but otherwise avoid.  

- **Option B – By Perception (What You See / What You Hear / How It Flows / What Characters Feel):**  *Intuition:* These labels match everyday thinking: novices immediately grasp “I control what the audience sees vs hears vs feels.” “What you see” (lighting, color, camera composition, costume, set) and “What you hear” (sound effects, music, silence) speak directly to senses. “How it flows” (pacing, transitions, editing coverage) and “What characters feel” (emotion, motivation, subtext) are less common terms but still conceptual. *Cross-requests:* “Darker” falls under *See*, “tenser” under *Feel*. The request spans two groups, but at least “Feel” is meant to cover emotion. It would require two fields. *Users:* Likely friendly to novices (they do think in “see/hear” when describing improvements). Professionals might find it a bit reductive (they think of specific camera moves or sync sound issues). *AI mapping:* Roughly splits by modality, which could map moderately to generation steps (vision model vs audio model vs editing). *Verdict:* Very intuitive and user-friendly. Captures most creative dimensions (though “What characters feel” might overlap with “How it flows” if we treat “tense” as pacing). We consider B a strong option especially for casual users.  

- **Option C – By Scope (Project-Wide / Scene / Shot):**  *Intuition:* Organizing by scope sounds logical (global style vs scene specifics vs shot details), but novices rarely categorize choices this way. They think in scenes more than “act vs entire movie”. *Cross-requests:* “Make the scene darker and tenser” is entirely scene-level, so under “Scene” this would be one panel. Easy if done right. If a request spanned acts vs global (e.g. “apply this filter throughout”), it’s handled at Project level. *Users:* Novices might be confused by “Project-wide” jargon. Professionals actually do think in passes (overall grade, then scene lighting, then shot camera). They might appreciate it. *AI mapping:* Good match to how models can take “global style prompt” vs “per-scene prompt” vs “per-shot parameters”. *Verdict:* Conceptually clean and matches generation structure, but novices may not use “scope” terms. It keeps all decisions at the right granularity but adds a layer users might ignore unless UI is very guided. We’d use this only if we can translate “scope” into user terms (e.g. “Global Style / Scene Mood / Shot Detail”).  

- **Option D – By Creative Concern (Look & Feel / Sound & Music / Rhythm & Flow / Character & Performance / Story World):**  *Intuition:* This aligns with actual filmmaking concerns and creative briefs. “Look & Feel” covers lighting, color, costume, set, framing; “Sound & Music” is clear; “Rhythm & Flow” (pacing, cuts, transitions) and “Character & Performance” (emotion, delivery, blocking) also use everyday terms (in fact, a creative brief might say “scene should look dour and feel claustrophobic” – that intersects Look & Feel and Character). “Story World” (character design, location design, props, continuity) is a bit abstract but could be framed to novices as “World Building”. *Cross-requests:* “Darker” hits *Look & Feel*, “tenser” hits *Character & Performance* – two groups. But this grouping explicitly covers those domains, and it’s obvious to an expert which is which. *Users:* Novices will understand “sound & music” and “look & feel” easily. “Rhythm & flow” might need explanation (“how fast/slow,” “smooth or jumpy”). Experts will like that no concern is missing. *AI mapping:* We earlier saw these correspond to internal modules (visual model vs audio model vs story metrics). So it’s workable. *Verdict:* This is the **most semantically rich** group, reflecting both user emotions (via “Character & Performance”) and technical aspects (“Look & Feel”). For beginners, you may need tooltips for “flow vs performance”, but it directly addresses most creative requests. Because it covers story continuity (Story World) too, it helps track cross-scene issues. Overall it best balances novices and experts. 

- **Recommended grouping:**  **Option D (By Creative Concern)**. It mirrors how directors talk about their vision (mood, look, sound, pacing, character) ([genero.com](https://genero.com/insights/mastering-the-art-of-creative-briefs#:~:text=This%20sounds%20simple%20but%20it,particular%20emotion%20we%20want%20to)) ([darkskiesfilm.com](https://darkskiesfilm.com/what-to-include-in-a-look-book-for-film/#:~:text=H3%20Lighting)), and maps well to both people’s mental models and AI parameters.   
- **Runner-up:**  **Option B (By Perception)**. Easier for laypeople who think in sensory terms, and simpler to implement. If a further simplified interface is needed, B is a good fallback.  
- **Avoid:**  Option A (crew roles) – it’s counter-intuitive for non-filmmakers, and broken requests cross tabs. Also avoid raw “scope” (Option C) without careful UI cues, since “Project vs Scene vs Shot” is not natural language (though it does align with technical workflow). 

- **Evidence:**  The lookbook guide shows directors organize by aesthetic elements (“lighting,” “color,” “camera movement,” etc.) ([darkskiesfilm.com](https://darkskiesfilm.com/what-to-include-in-a-look-book-for-film/#:~:text=H3%20Lighting)). The creative brief quote explicitly says choices like lighting, camera moves, and color are tools for emotion ([genero.com](https://genero.com/insights/mastering-the-art-of-creative-briefs#:~:text=This%20sounds%20simple%20but%20it,particular%20emotion%20we%20want%20to)), suggesting grouping by concern rather than department. Our user research (Section 4) indicates novices describe changes by sensory/feeling categories, not by crew. These lines of evidence support groupings D (creative concerns) and B (sensory terms) as closest to user language and industry practice.
