# Ideas Backlog

Ideas worth keeping but not in scope for current work. Review periodically.

---

## UI / Interaction

- **Ghost-text inline suggestions** (GitHub Copilot pattern): Show AI suggestions as faded text inline with the user's content. User presses Tab to accept, keeps typing to dismiss. Great for script editing, bible enrichment, config tuning. *(Source: 011b landscape research)*

- **AI preference learning from user choices**: Every time we suggest something (or multiple variants) and the user chooses one, modifies a result, or adjusts an AI decision (e.g. scene split point), save both the AI suggestion and the user's final choice. This is training data for making future suggestions better. First-class architectural concept, not an afterthought. *(Source: Cam, 011b review)*

- **Entity graph visualization**: Visual graph of character/location/prop relationships. May be overkill — character relationships could just be a list view in the character bible. Revisit if entity count grows. *(Source: 011b landscape research)*

## Workflow

- **Story-to-screenplay conversion**: For non-screenplay inputs (short stories, novels, treatments), send to a strong model with "make this into a screenplay" and take the output. Good for commercials and short-form. Not primary workflow but worth having as a convenience path. *(Source: Cam, 011b review)*
