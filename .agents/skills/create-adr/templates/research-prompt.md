# Research Prompt

## Context

{Copy the Context section from the ADR, plus any additional background the researcher needs.}

## What I Need

{Break the research into numbered sections with specific questions. Be concrete — tell the researcher exactly what to evaluate and compare.}

## Output Format

For each category, provide:
1. **Recommended choice** with reasoning
2. **Runner-up** and when you'd pick it instead
3. **Avoid** — What looks tempting but has known issues
4. **Evidence** — Links, benchmarks, community sentiment, adoption data
