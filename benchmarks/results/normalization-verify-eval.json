However, it fails significantly on structural correctness: (1) dialogue retains quotation marks, which is non-standard for Fountain; (2) prose attribution tags like 'June says, setting down the mugs' and 'Noah tries to sound calm' are embedded directly in dialogue blocks rather than being converted to parentheticals or action lines; (3) no parentheticals are used at all despite many opportunities; (4) the result is a prose-screenplay hybrid rather than proper Fountain format. Content preservation is mixed—the words are mostly there but improperly structured.",

Aria threads a tape reel as Noah checks the cracked mixer. June comes in balancing two mugs of tea on a pile of scripts.\n\nJUNE\n(setting down the mugs)\nIf this works, half the valley hears us.\n\nNoah tries to sound calm.\n\nNOAH\nIf this works, we hear them too.\n\nARIA\n(quietly)\nThen we stop talking and start listening.\n\nThe ON AIR light flickers once, then goes dark.\n\nEXT. HILLTOP WATER TOWER - NIGHT\n\nLater that night, on a hilltop water tower, wind whips prayer flags tied to the guardrail. Aria and Noah climb a rusted service ladder carrying a portable antenna. Below them, town lights blink in scattered clusters.\n\nNOAH\n(shivering)\nI still vote for warm studios and bad coffee.\n\nAria grins.\n\nARIA\nWe lost warm. Keep the coffee dream alive.\n\nA burst of static crackles from the handheld receiver. They both freeze.\n\nNOAH\n(whispering)\nDid you hear that?\n\nARIA\nOnly enough to hope.\n\nThey lock the antenna in place and point it toward the dark ridge line.\n\nINT. STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nDown in the studio hallway, fluorescent lights buzz overhead. Kell tapes handwritten evacuation arrows to the wall while June hurries past carrying batteries and tangled cables.\n\nKELL\nGenerator room flooded. We can run one board, maybe two.\n\nJUNE\nOne board is enough.\n\nKell raises an eyebrow.\n\nKELL\nFor news, maybe. For miracles?\n\nJune half-smiles.\n\nJUNE\nWe schedule those after midnight.\n\nShe shoulders open the control-room door.\n\nINT. COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - CONTINUOUS\n\nInside the studio, monitors glow back to life one by one.\n\nNOAH (V.O.)\nTower looks stable. Feed us a carrier tone.\n\nJune taps the mic.\n\nJUNE\nGood evening, Red Creek. If you're out there, key once and wait.\n\nSilence. Then three tiny chirps answer in sequence. The room goes still.",

Are parentheticals in (lowercase parens) format?\n5. Is there NO markdown formatting (no >, #, **, ``` etc.)?\n6. Are scene breaks identified correctly from context clues in the original?\n7. Is the author's voice preserved without inventions? Compare against the original input.\n\nScore strictly: structural correctness AND content preservation both matter.\n"

STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT', 'INT. COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - CONTINUOUS' — all in ALL CAPS. ✅\n\n2. **Character cues ALL CAPS**: ARIA, NOAH, JUNE, KELL are all in ALL CAPS. ✅\n\n3. **Markdown artifacts removed**: \n - No `##` before CUT TO ✅\n - No `>` before parentheticals ✅\n - No `\\-` — the output uses clean hyphens in 'WATER TOWER - NIGHT', 'STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT', 'control-room door' ✅\n - All markdown artifacts appear to be cleaned. ✅\n\n4. **Dialogue preserved exactly**: Checking key lines:\n - 'If this works, half the valley hears us.' ✅\n - 'If this works, we hear them too.' ✅\n - 'Then we stop talking and start listening.' ✅\n - 'I still vote for warm studios and bad coffee.' ✅\n - 'We lost warm. Keep the coffee dream alive.' ✅\n - 'Did you hear that?' ✅\n - 'Only enough to hope.' ✅\n - 'Generator room flooded. We can run one board, maybe two.' ✅\n - 'One board is enough.' ✅\n - 'For news, maybe. For miracles?' ✅\n - 'We schedule those after midnight.' ✅\n - 'Tower looks stable. Feed us a carrier tone.' ✅\n - 'Good evening, Red Creek. If you're out there, key once and wait.' ✅\n - 'Silence. Then three tiny chirps answer in sequence. The room goes still.' ✅\n\n5. **Parentheticals formatted correctly**: '(trying to sound calm)' and '(half-smiling)' are on their own lines under character names, in parentheses. The escaped hyphen `\\-` in `half\\-smiling` is now clean `half-smiling`. ✅\n\n6. **V.O. designation preserved**: 'NOAH (V.O.)' is present. ✅\n\n7. **CUT TO: is plain text**: 'CUT TO:' appears without `##` markdown header formatting. ✅\n\nAll seven criteria are met. The cleanup is thorough — all markdown artifacts (##, >, \\-) have been removed, case has been corrected for scene headings and character names, and the screenplay content is faithfully preserved.",

STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT', 'INT. COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - CONTINUOUS' — all in ALL CAPS. ✅\n\n2. **Character cues ALL CAPS**: JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL — all ALL CAPS. ✅\n\n3. **Markdown artifacts removed**: \n - No `##` before CUT TO ✅\n - No `>` before parentheticals ✅\n - No `\\-` — the hyphens appear as plain `-` in 'NIGHT', 'control-room door' ✅\n - No escaped characters visible ✅\n\n4. **Dialogue preserved exactly**: Checking key lines:\n - 'If this works, half the valley hears us.' ✅\n - 'If this works, we hear them too.' ✅\n - 'Then we stop talking and start listening.' ✅\n - 'I still vote for warm studios and bad coffee.' ✅\n - 'We lost warm. Keep the coffee dream alive.' ✅\n - 'Did you hear that?' ✅\n - 'Only enough to hope.' ✅\n - 'Generator room flooded. We can run one board, maybe two.' ✅\n - 'One board is enough.' ✅\n - 'For news, maybe. For miracles?' ✅\n - 'We schedule those after midnight.' ✅\n - 'Tower looks stable. Feed us a carrier tone.' ✅\n - 'Good evening, Red Creek. If you\\'re out there, key once and wait.' ✅\n\n5. **Parentheticals formatted correctly**: '(trying to sound calm)' and '(half-smiling)' are on their own lines under character names, in parentheses. The `\\-` in `half\\-smiling` is now `half-smiling`. ✅\n\n6. **V.O. designation preserved**: 'NOAH (V.O.)' ✅\n\n7. **CUT TO: as plain text**: 'CUT TO:' appears without `##`. ✅\n\nAdditional observations:\n- The output adds a 'TITLE: SIGNAL IN THE RAIN' header which wasn't strictly in standard Fountain format but is a reasonable normalization.\n- Character names in action lines are capitalized (e.g., 'Aria threads a tape reel while Noah checks a cracked mixer') — properly capitalized from the lowercase input.\n- The overall formatting is clean and professional screenplay format.\n\nAll seven criteria are met.
