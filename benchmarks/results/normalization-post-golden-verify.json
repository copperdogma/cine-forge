HILLTOP WATER TOWER - LATER NIGHT, INT. RADIO STUDIO HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS, INT. RADIO STUDIO - CONTINUOUS. All caps, proper INT./EXT. prefixes. ✓\n\n2. **Character cues**: JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL, NOAH (O.S.) - all caps on their own lines. ✓\n\n3. **Dialogue preservation**: Without the original prose input to compare against, I cannot verify exact preservation. However, the dialogue reads naturally and consistently. The rubric states the input was a prose narrative, so the model had to extract/create dialogue from prose - but the rubric also says 'dialogue preserved exactly as written' and 'author's voice preserved without inventions.' Since I don't have the original input, I'll evaluate the output on its own structural merits.\n\n4. **Parentheticals**: There's NOAH (O.S.) which is a character extension, not a parenthetical. No standard parentheticals like (beat) or (whispering) are present. This isn't necessarily wrong if the source material didn't call for them. Neutral.\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: No >, #, **, ``` or other markdown. Clean text. ✓\n\n6. **Scene breaks**: Four scenes are identified with logical transitions (NIGHT → LATER NIGHT → CONTINUOUS → CONTINUOUS). Scene breaks seem logical based on location changes. ✓\n\n7. **Author's voice**: The writing feels cohesive and purposeful. Action lines are present and descriptive without being overly embellished.\n\nAdditional structural notes: Action/description lines are present and properly formatted (not in caps, not indented like dialogue). The SOUND notation at the beginning is a minor stylistic choice. Overall the Fountain formatting is quite solid.\n\nHowever, a critical issue: the rubric says 'The input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting. The model should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' Without seeing the original input, I must assess whether this looks like a faithful conversion. The output is well-structured Fountain format. But I cannot fully verify content preservation or whether inventions were made.\n\nGiven the structural quality is high and formatting is correct, but with uncertainty about faithfulness to source material, I'll score moderately high.",

              "reason": "Evaluating against the rubric criteria:\n\n1. **Scene headings (INT./EXT. ALL CAPS):** Yes - 'INT. COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - DAY', 'EXT. HILLTOP WATER TOWER - NIGHT', 'INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT' are all properly formatted in ALL CAPS with INT./EXT. prefixes and time of day.\n\n2. **Character cues ALL CAPS on their own line:** Yes - JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL, NOAH (V.O.) all appear in ALL CAPS on their own lines before dialogue.\n\n3. **Dialogue preserved exactly as written:** The rubric states the input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting, so the model was supposed to convert prose into screenplay format. Without seeing the original input, I can assess that the dialogue appears natural and consistent. However, I cannot verify exact preservation without the original.\n\n4. **Parentheticals in (lowercase parens) format:** Yes - '(shivering)', '(whispers)', '(half-smiles)' are all in lowercase parentheses. However, some parentheticals appear on the same line as character names (e.g., NOAH followed by (shivering) on a separate line after dialogue, and (whispers) after dialogue). In standard Fountain, parentheticals should appear between the character cue and dialogue. The placement of '(shivering)' and '(whispers)' after dialogue lines rather than before them is non-standard Fountain formatting.\n\n5. **No markdown formatting:** Correct - there are no markdown symbols like >, #, **, ``` etc.\n\n6. **Scene breaks identified correctly:** The three scenes flow logically - studio setup, hilltop antenna installation, then back to studio hallway/control room. These seem like reasonable scene breaks.\n\n7. **Author's voice preserved without inventions:** Without the original prose, this is hard to fully verify, but the output reads as a coherent screenplay adaptation.\n\nIssues: Some parentheticals are placed after dialogue rather than before (non-standard placement). Also, some action/description lines could be more clearly delineated. The formatting is mostly correct but has minor structural issues with parenthetical placement. The overall conversion appears competent with good Fountain conventions applied, though not perfect.",

HILLTOP WATER TOWER - LATER THAT NIGHT, INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS, INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS. All caps, proper INT./EXT. prefixes. ✓\n\n2. **Character cues**: JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL are all in ALL CAPS on their own lines before dialogue. ✓\n\n3. **Dialogue preservation**: The dialogue appears natural and consistent. However, without the original prose input to compare against, I can only assess whether the dialogue reads as coherent and well-structured, which it does. There's a concern though - the rubric states 'The input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting' and the model 'should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' Without seeing the original input, I must assess the output on its structural merits and whether it appears to be a faithful conversion.\n\n4. **Parentheticals**: Present in (lowercase parens) format - (trying to sound calm), (shivering), (grinning), (whispering), (raising an eyebrow), (half-smiling), (voice through radio), (tapping the mic). ✓\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: No >, #, **, ``` or other markdown artifacts present. ✓\n\n6. **Scene breaks**: Four distinct scenes are identified with proper headings, and transitions seem logical (LATER THAT NIGHT, CONTINUOUS). ✓\n\n7. **Author's voice preservation**: There are action/description lines interspersed that read like prose narration converted to screenplay action lines. However, some lines like 'Aria replies quietly' feel like leftover prose narration rather than proper action lines (a proper action line would just describe the action, not attribute dialogue). Similarly 'June sets down the mugs' after June's dialogue feels slightly awkward in placement. These suggest the conversion wasn't perfectly clean - some prose artifacts remain.\n\nOne notable issue: the parenthetical '(whispering)' appears AFTER Noah's dialogue line 'Did you hear that?' rather than before it, which is non-standard Fountain formatting. Parentheticals should precede the dialogue they modify.\n\nOverall, the formatting is largely correct with minor issues in parenthetical placement and some residual prose-style action lines.",

CRAMPED COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - NIGHT', 'EXT. HILLTOP WATER TOWER - NIGHT', 'INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT', 'INT. RADIO STUDIO - NIGHT' — all properly formatted in ALL CAPS with INT./EXT. prefixes and time of day.\n\n2. **Character cues ALL CAPS on their own line?** - Yes. JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL, NOAH (V.O.) all appear in ALL CAPS on their own lines before dialogue.\n\n3. **Dialogue preserved exactly as written?** - Since the rubric states the input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting, I cannot compare directly to the original input. However, the dialogue appears natural and consistent. The rubric also asks about content preservation (criterion 7).\n\n4. **Parentheticals in (lowercase parens) format?** - There don't appear to be explicit parentheticals used, though some action lines like 'He shivers.' appear as action lines rather than parentheticals. This is acceptable Fountain practice for standalone physical actions.\n\n5. **No markdown formatting?** - Correct. There are no >, #, **, ``` or other markdown artifacts. The output is clean Fountain-style text.\n\n6. **Scene breaks identified correctly from context clues?** - Yes. Scene transitions are logical: studio → hilltop water tower → studio hallway → radio studio. Each location change gets a proper scene heading.\n\n7. **Author's voice preserved without inventions?** - Without seeing the original prose input, I cannot fully verify this, but the writing feels cohesive and consistent in tone.\n\nThe output is well-structured Fountain format. Action lines are properly placed between scene headings and dialogue. Character names are correctly capitalized. The V.O. designation for Noah's off-screen line is appropriate. However, there's a notable issue: the rubric says the input was a prose narrative, meaning the model should have *converted* prose into this format. The output looks like a competent Fountain screenplay. One minor issue: in strict Fountain format, there should be blank lines before scene headings and character names, which we can't fully verify in this rendering but the structure appears correct. The formatting is clean and professional.",

The model should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' Without seeing the original prose input, I cannot fully verify that dialogue was preserved 'exactly as written' or that no inventions were made. But taking the output on its own merits, the Fountain formatting is well-executed. The structure is clean, consistent, and follows standard screenplay/Fountain conventions. Action lines are properly placed, transitions like CONTINUOUS are used correctly, and the formatting is professional. One minor note: in strict Fountain spec, scene headings don't need to be manually capitalized as the parser handles that, but ALL CAPS is the widely accepted convention and is correct here. Overall this is a high-quality Fountain-formatted screenplay.",

However, the rubric states 'The input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting. The model should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' This implies there was an original prose input that was converted. Without seeing the original input, I cannot fully verify that dialogue was preserved 'exactly as written' or that no inventions were made. The output itself is well-structured Fountain format. There's also the question of whether action lines should have more specific formatting. The action/description lines are written in standard screenplay prose style, which is correct. One minor issue: CONTINUOUS is used as a time-of-day marker which is standard. V.O. notation is correctly applied. Overall, the structural formatting is quite good and follows Fountain conventions well.",

COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO, EXT. HILLTOP WATER TOWER - NIGHT, INT. STUDIO HALLWAY). 2) Character cues are ALL CAPS on their own lines (JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL). 3) Dialogue appears naturally preserved and well-written. 4) Parentheticals are in (lowercase parens) format, e.g., (tries to sound calm), (quietly), (shivering), (whispers). 5) There is no markdown formatting - no #, **, ```, or > symbols. 6) Scene breaks are identified with proper scene headings. 7) The author's voice appears preserved with action lines and dialogue that feel natural.\n\nHowever, the rubric states 'The input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting. The model should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' This implies there was an original prose input that was converted. Without seeing the original input, I cannot verify that dialogue was 'preserved exactly as written' or that the author's voice was preserved 'without inventions.' The output could be entirely generated rather than converted from an existing prose piece. But evaluating what's presented: the Fountain formatting itself is well-executed. Action lines could arguably be more clearly separated from scene headings in strict Fountain (blank lines between elements), but the structure is generally correct. One minor issue: in strict Fountain, scene headings typically need a blank line before them, and the formatting shown appears to follow this convention. The output is clean and professional-looking Fountain format.",

Scene breaks are clearly delineated. However, the rubric states 'The input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting. The model should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' We have no original prose input to compare against, so we cannot verify that dialogue was 'preserved exactly as written' or that the 'author's voice preserved without inventions.' The output itself looks like a well-formatted Fountain screenplay, but it could have been generated from scratch rather than converted from prose. That said, evaluating what we can see: (1) Scene headings are properly formatted - YES. (2) Character cues ALL CAPS on own line - YES. (3) Dialogue preservation - cannot verify without input, but dialogue is present and formatted correctly. (4) Parentheticals in correct format - YES. (5) No markdown formatting - YES, the output is clean Fountain. (6) Scene breaks identified - YES, there are clear INT/EXT transitions including a CONTINUOUS tag. (7) Author's voice - cannot fully verify. The structural formatting is excellent and meets Fountain standards. The content reads naturally and coherently. Given that we can only evaluate what's presented, the formatting quality is high, though we must note the inability to verify exact content preservation.",

However, there's a significant issue with the rubric: it states 'The input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting' and the model 'should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' Without seeing the original prose input, I cannot verify that dialogue was preserved exactly or that no content was invented. The output itself is well-structured Fountain format, but the claim about conversion from prose cannot be fully verified. Taking the output at face value for structural correctness: scene headings, character cues, parentheticals, and general Fountain conventions are all properly applied. The formatting is clean with no markdown artifacts. Action lines are properly formatted. V.O. notation is correctly used. The output scores well on structural correctness.",

Without seeing the original input, I must evaluate the output on its own merits. The output is well-structured Fountain format. One concern: the rubric asks if dialogue is 'preserved exactly as written' - without the original, I can only assess that dialogue appears coherent and consistent. The rubric also asks about 'inventions' - again, without the original, I trust the content is faithful.\n\nThe formatting is quite good but has minor issues: action/description lines could benefit from more standard spacing conventions in strict Fountain spec, and CONTINUOUS is properly used. Overall this is a solid Fountain-formatted screenplay.",

There are no #, **, >, ``` or other markdown symbols. The output is plain text in Fountain-style formatting.\n\n6. **Scene breaks identified correctly from context clues**: Yes. The scene transitions make logical sense - from studio to hilltop water tower to studio hallway back to studio (CONTINUOUS). These appear to be reasonable scene break identifications.\n\n7. **Author's voice preserved without inventions**: The action lines contain descriptive prose that reads like it was converted from narrative. Without the original input I can't verify nothing was invented, but the content appears consistent and natural.\n\nHowever, there are some minor Fountain formatting issues: In strict Fountain format, action lines should be separated by blank lines from scene headings and character names. The output appears to use descriptive prose paragraphs as action lines, which is acceptable. The overall structure is solid Fountain formatting.\n\nOne issue: The action/description lines are written in present tense prose style which is correct for screenplays. The formatting is clean and professional.\n\nOverall this is a strong conversion to Fountain format with proper structural elements.",

The text is clean.\n\n4. **Dialogue preserved**: The dialogue appears natural and well-formatted. However, since I don't have the original input to compare word-for-word, I can only verify the output looks like properly formatted screenplay dialogue. The rubric says dialogue should be preserved exactly, but without the original input visible, I'll assess based on the output's internal consistency and formatting quality.\n\n5. **Parentheticals formatted correctly**: Yes - '(trying to sound calm)' and '(half-smiling)' are on their own lines, in parentheses, which is correct Fountain/screenplay format.\n\n6. **V.O. designation preserved**: Yes - 'NOAH (V.O.)' is present and correctly formatted.\n\n7. **CUT TO: transition**: 'CUT TO:' appears as plain text, not as a markdown header. Correct.\n\nThe output appears to be a clean, properly formatted screenplay with all markdown artifacts removed and proper Fountain conventions applied. All seven criteria appear to be met.",
