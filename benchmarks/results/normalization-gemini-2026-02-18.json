HILLTOP WATER TOWER - LATER NIGHT, INT. RADIO STUDIO HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS, INT. RADIO STUDIO - CONTINUOUS. All caps, proper INT./EXT. prefixes. ✓\n\n2. **Character cues**: JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL, NOAH (O.S.) - all caps on their own lines. ✓\n\n3. **Dialogue preservation**: Without the original prose input to compare against, I cannot verify exact preservation. However, the dialogue reads naturally and consistently. The rubric states the input was a prose narrative, so the model had to extract/convert dialogue. The dialogue appears well-formed. Partial ✓\n\n4. **Parentheticals**: There are no parentheticals used in this screenplay. Action lines describe physical actions rather than using parentheticals. This isn't necessarily wrong - if the original prose didn't have delivery instructions embedded in dialogue, parentheticals wouldn't be needed. Neutral.\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: No >, #, **, ``` or other markdown artifacts present. ✓\n\n6. **Scene breaks**: Four distinct scenes are identified with proper slug lines, and transitions between locations seem logical (studio → hilltop → hallway → studio). ✓\n\n7. **Author's voice preservation**: The tone is consistent - spare, atmospheric, understated. Action lines like \"SOUND of old gear humming\" and descriptions feel purposeful. Without the original, hard to fully verify no inventions, but nothing feels out of place.\n\nHowever, there's a significant issue with the rubric premise: it states 'The input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting. The model should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' I don't have the original input to verify content preservation exactly. The output itself is well-structured Fountain-style screenplay formatting. But there are some minor issues: action/description lines could be more clearly separated in standard Fountain (though this is acceptable). The SOUND direction at the top isn't standard Fountain convention.\n\nOverall, the structural formatting is solid and follows Fountain conventions well. The output is clean, professional screenplay format without markdown artifacts.",

The model should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' This implies there was an original prose input that needed conversion. Without seeing the original input, I cannot verify that dialogue was 'preserved exactly as written' or that the author's voice was preserved 'without inventions.' The output could be entirely generated rather than converted from existing prose. But evaluating what's presented: the Fountain formatting itself is well-executed. The structural elements are correct. There are minor issues - some action lines could be more clearly separated, and the scene headings could include more specific location details in some cases. The formatting is clean and professional Fountain format overall.\n\nSince I cannot verify content preservation against an original, but the structural formatting is solid, I'll score moderately high for the formatting quality while noting the uncertainty about faithful conversion.",

COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - DAY, EXT. HILLTOP WATER TOWER - NIGHT, INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT, INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS). 2) Character cues are ALL CAPS on their own lines (JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL). 3) Dialogue appears naturally preserved and well-written. 4) Parentheticals are in (lowercase parens) format: (quietly), (shivering), (whispering), (half-smiling), (V.O.). 5) There is no markdown formatting - no #, **, ```, or > symbols. 6) Scene breaks are logically identified with clear location/time changes. 7) The author's voice appears preserved with action lines and dialogue that feel organic. However, the rubric states 'The input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting. The model should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' Without seeing the original prose input, I cannot verify that dialogue was preserved 'exactly as written' or that no content was invented. The output itself is well-structured Fountain format. One minor issue: in strict Fountain spec, scene headings don't need to be manually formatted since the parser recognizes INT./EXT., but having them in ALL CAPS is standard practice. The formatting is clean and professional. Given that I cannot verify exact content preservation from the original, but the structural formatting is excellent, I'll score this highly with a small deduction for the uncertainty about content fidelity.",

Aria threads a tape reel as Noah checks the cracked mixer. June comes in balancing two mugs of tea on a pile of scripts.\n\nJUNE\nIf this works, half the valley hears us.\n\nJune sets down the mugs. Noah tries to sound calm.\n\nNOAH\nIf this works, we hear them too.\n\nARIA\n(quietly)\nThen we stop talking and start listening.\n\nThe ON AIR light flickers once, then goes dark.\n\nEXT. HILLTOP WATER TOWER - NIGHT\n\nLater that night, wind whips prayer flags tied to the guardrail. Aria and Noah climb a rusted service ladder carrying a portable antenna. Below them, town lights blink in scattered clusters.\n\nNOAH\n(shivering)\nI still vote for warm studios and bad coffee.\n\nAria grins.\n\nARIA\nWe lost warm. Keep the coffee dream alive.\n\nA burst of static crackles from the handheld receiver. They both freeze.\n\nNOAH\n(whispering)\nDid you hear that?\n\nARIA\nOnly enough to hope.\n\nThey lock the antenna in place and point it toward the dark ridge line.\n\nINT. STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nFluorescent lights buzz overhead. Kell tapes handwritten evacuation arrows to the wall while June hurries past carrying batteries and tangled cables.\n\nKELL\nGenerator room flooded. We can run one board, maybe two.\n\nJUNE\nOne board is enough.\n\nKell raises an eyebrow.\n\nKELL\nFor news, maybe. For miracles?\n\nJUNE\n(half-smiling)\nWe schedule those after midnight.\n\nShe shoulders open the control-room door.\n\nINT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS\n\nInside the studio, monitors glow back to life one by one. Noah's voice comes through the radio.\n\nNOAH (V.O.)\nTower looks stable. Feed us a carrier tone.\n\nJune taps the mic.\n\nJUNE\nGood evening, Red Creek. If you're out there, key once and wait.\n\nSilence. Then three tiny chirps answer in sequence. The room goes still.",

However, since the rubric states the input was a prose narrative, I cannot verify exact preservation against the original. The dialogue reads coherently and consistently. Assumed ✓\n\n4. **Parentheticals**: (trying to sound calm), (quietly), (shivering), (whispering) - all in lowercase within parentheses on their own lines. ✓\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: No >, #, **, ``` or other markdown symbols present. The output is clean Fountain-style plain text. ✓\n\n6. **Scene breaks**: Four distinct scenes are identified with appropriate headings, and transitions between locations (studio → hilltop → hallway → control room) flow logically with CONTINUOUS used appropriately. ✓\n\n7. **Author's voice preservation**: Action lines describe settings and character actions without excessive embellishment. The tone feels consistent. Without seeing the original prose, this appears faithful. Assumed ✓\n\nThe output demonstrates strong Fountain formatting conventions: scene headings are correct, character names are capitalized, parentheticals are properly formatted, action lines are present, and there's no markdown contamination. The V.O. notation for Noah's off-screen line is also correctly applied. The structure is clean and professional.\n\nMinor note: Standard Fountain format typically expects a blank line before scene headings and character cues, which appears to be present. The overall formatting is quite good.",

The rubric says the input was a prose narrative, so the model extracted and formatted dialogue. The dialogue appears coherent and well-structured.\n\n4. **Parentheticals in (lowercase parens) format**: Yes. We see (setting down the mugs), (quietly), (shivering), (whispering) - all in lowercase parentheses on their own lines.\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: Correct. There are no #, **, >, ``` or other markdown artifacts. The output is clean Fountain-style plain text.\n\n6. **Scene breaks identified correctly from context clues**: Yes. The scene transitions make logical sense - studio interior, exterior water tower, studio hallway, back to studio (CONTINUOUS). These appear to be reasonable scene break identifications.\n\n7. **Author's voice preserved without inventions**: The action lines read as natural conversions from prose to screenplay format. Without the original input I cannot verify 100% fidelity, but the writing feels consistent and doesn't show signs of invention.\n\nStructural issues to note: In standard Fountain format, action lines between scene headings and character names are present and properly formatted. The overall structure follows Fountain conventions well. One minor note: Fountain format typically doesn't use bold/italic for scene headings - they're recognized by the INT./EXT. prefix, which is correctly done here.\n\nOverall this is a strong Fountain normalization with proper scene headings, character cues, parentheticals, dialogue formatting, and no markdown artifacts.",

COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - CONTINUOUS' are all in ALL CAPS.\n\n2. **Character cues ALL CAPS**: Yes - JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL, NOAH (V.O.) are all in ALL CAPS.\n\n3. **Markdown artifacts removed**: Yes - There are no ##, >, \\-, \\! or other markdown artifacts visible in the output. The text is clean.\n\n4. **Dialogue preserved exactly**: Without seeing the original input, I can assess that the dialogue appears natural and complete. The rubric mentions the input had markdown artifacts, and the output dialogue reads cleanly.\n\n5. **Parentheticals formatted correctly**: Yes - '(trying to sound calm)' and '(half-smiling)' are on their own lines in parentheses, which is standard screenplay format.\n\n6. **V.O. designation preserved**: Yes - 'NOAH (V.O.)' is present and correctly formatted.\n\n7. **CUT TO: transition**: Yes - 'CUT TO:' appears as plain text, not as a markdown header.\n\nThe output appears to be a well-formatted screenplay with all markdown artifacts removed and proper Fountain/screenplay conventions followed. All seven criteria are met.",
