HILLTOP WATER TOWER - LATER NIGHT, INT. RADIO STUDIO HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS, INT. RADIO STUDIO - CONTINUOUS. All caps, proper INT./EXT. prefixes. ✓\n\n2. **Character cues**: JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL, NOAH (O.S.) - all caps on their own lines. ✓\n\n3. **Dialogue preservation**: Without the original prose input to compare against, I cannot verify exact preservation. However, the dialogue reads naturally and consistently. The rubric states the input was a prose narrative, so the model had to extract/convert dialogue. The dialogue appears well-formed. Partial ✓\n\n4. **Parentheticals**: There are no parentheticals used in this screenplay. Action lines describe physical actions rather than using parentheticals. This isn't necessarily wrong - if the original prose didn't have delivery instructions embedded in dialogue, parentheticals wouldn't be needed. Neutral.\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: No >, #, **, ``` or other markdown artifacts present. ✓\n\n6. **Scene breaks**: Four distinct scenes are identified with proper scene headings, and the transitions (LATER NIGHT, CONTINUOUS) suggest logical scene breaks were identified from context. ✓\n\n7. **Author's voice preserved without inventions**: Without the original input, this is hard to fully verify. However, the rubric says the input was a prose narrative that needed conversion. The key question is whether the model invented content or faithfully converted. The writing has a consistent voice and doesn't show signs of padding or invention.\n\nHowever, there's a significant concern: the rubric says this was supposed to be a conversion from prose to Fountain format. The output uses standard screenplay formatting but there are some Fountain-specific concerns - in strict Fountain format, action lines and scene headings have specific spacing requirements. The output appears to be in general screenplay format which is close to Fountain but the evaluation can't confirm perfect Fountain spec compliance.\n\nAlso, without seeing the original prose input, I cannot fully verify content preservation (criterion 3 and 7). But structurally, the formatting is solid and clean.\n\nOverall: Strong structural formatting, clean presentation, proper screenplay conventions followed, no markdown artifacts. Minor uncertainty about exact content preservation without the original.",

HILLTOP WATER TOWER - NIGHT', 'INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT' are all in ALL CAPS with proper INT./EXT. prefixes. ✓\n\n2. **Character cues**: JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL are ALL CAPS on their own lines before dialogue. NOAH (V.O.) is also properly formatted. ✓\n\n3. **Dialogue preservation**: The dialogue appears natural and well-written. However, the rubric states this was supposed to be a conversion from a prose narrative input. Without seeing the original input, I must assess whether the dialogue reads as preserved rather than invented. The rubric says 'the input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting' and the model 'should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' This implies there was source material to convert. The output looks like it could be an original screenplay rather than a conversion from prose - but I can only evaluate what's presented.\n\n4. **Parentheticals**: '(shivering)', '(whispers)', '(half-smiles)' are in lowercase parentheses format. ✓\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: There are no #, **, ```, or > symbols. The output is clean Fountain-style plain text. ✓\n\n6. **Scene breaks**: Three distinct scenes are identified with proper scene headings, and transitions between locations seem logical. ✓\n\n7. **Author's voice preservation**: Without the original prose input to compare, this is hard to fully verify. The rubric says 'without inventions,' meaning the model shouldn't add content not in the original.\n\nThe fundamental issue is that the rubric says this should be a *conversion* from prose narrative input. Without the original input, the output appears well-structured as Fountain format. The formatting is largely correct. Action lines are present and properly placed. Character names are capitalized. Parentheticals are correctly formatted. Scene headings follow convention.\n\nOne minor issue: some parentheticals like '(shivering)' and '(whispers)' appear after the character name but on a separate line after the first dialogue line rather than between the character cue and dialogue, which is slightly non-standard placement in some cases. '(shivering)' appears after Noah's dialogue line rather than before it.\n\nOverall the Fountain formatting is solid, clean, and professional. Assuming the content faithfully represents a conversion, the structural quality is high.",

However, the rubric states 'The input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting' and the model 'should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' Without seeing the original prose input, I cannot verify that dialogue was preserved EXACTLY as written or that no content was invented. The output itself is well-structured Fountain format, but I must note this concern. The structural formatting is quite good - scene headings, character names, parentheticals, action lines, and dialogue all follow Fountain conventions properly. One minor issue: in strict Fountain format, scene headings don't need to be followed by blank lines in a specific way, but the general structure is correct. The content reads coherently and the voice is consistent throughout. Given that I cannot verify exact preservation against the original, but the structural formatting is excellent and the content appears natural without obvious inventions, I'll score this highly but not perfectly.",

The conversion from prose to screenplay format seems to preserve dialogue content. However, I cannot verify exact preservation without the original. The dialogue reads naturally and doesn't appear to have inventions. ✓ (assumed)\n\n4. **Parentheticals**: There are no parentheticals used in this screenplay. Some action descriptions are embedded in action lines rather than parentheticals (e.g., 'He shivers' as an action line rather than a parenthetical). This is acceptable Fountain formatting. ✓\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: The output contains no markdown symbols like >, #, **, ```, etc. It's clean plain text in Fountain style. ✓\n\n6. **Scene breaks identified correctly**: The transitions between locations (studio → hilltop water tower → studio hallway → back to studio) are logically broken with appropriate scene headings. The use of V.O. for Noah when he's on the tower communicating via radio is correct. ✓\n\n7. **Author's voice preserved**: The action lines contain descriptive prose that reads like it was converted from narrative ('wind whips prayer flags tied to the guardrail', 'old gear hums while rain taps on the skylight'). This suggests faithful conversion. ✓\n\nMinor issues: The action/description lines are written in a somewhat prose-heavy style, which could be from the original narrative. Some action lines could be more tightly formatted for standard screenplay convention, but for Fountain format conversion from prose, this is solid work. The structure is clean and readable.\n\nOverall, this is a well-executed conversion to Fountain format with proper structural elements and apparent content preservation.",

STUDIO HALLWAY - NIGHT, INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS. All are in ALL CAPS with proper INT./EXT. prefixes. ✓\n\n2. **Character cues**: JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL are all in ALL CAPS on their own lines before dialogue. NOAH (V.O.) is also properly formatted. ✓\n\n3. **Dialogue preservation**: The dialogue appears natural and well-preserved. Without the original prose input to compare against exactly, the dialogue reads consistently and naturally. However, the rubric states this was converted from a prose narrative - the dialogue appears to be faithfully rendered. ✓\n\n4. **Parentheticals**: All in (lowercase parens) format - (trying to sound calm), (quietly), (shivering), (grinning), (whispers), (raising an eyebrow), (half-smiling), (through the radio). ✓\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: No >, #, **, ``` or other markdown artifacts present. The output is clean Fountain-style text. ✓\n\n6. **Scene breaks**: Four distinct scenes are identified - the studio, the hilltop water tower, the studio hallway, and the control room. These seem logically derived from location/time changes. The CONTINUOUS tag on the last scene is appropriate. ✓\n\n7. **Author's voice preservation**: Action lines describe settings and character actions in a way that feels like faithful conversion from prose. Lines like 'wind whips prayer flags tied to the guardrail' and 'fluorescent lights buzz overhead' feel like preserved descriptive prose rather than inventions. Without seeing the original input, this appears faithful. ✓\n\nMinor issues: The action/description lines between scene headings and dialogue are present and serve as proper scene description. The formatting is clean and follows Fountain conventions well. One small note: in strict Fountain format, there's typically a blank line before character names, which appears to be maintained here.\n\nOverall this is a well-structured Fountain screenplay conversion with proper formatting throughout.",

COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO - DAY, EXT. HILLTOP WATER TOWER - NIGHT, etc.). 2) Character cues are ALL CAPS on their own lines (JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL). 3) Dialogue appears naturally formatted below character names. 4) Parentheticals are in (lowercase parens) format - e.g., (trying to sound calm), (quietly), (shivering), (grinning), etc. 5) There is no markdown formatting - no >, #, **, ``` or similar artifacts. 6) Scene breaks are logically identified with proper sluglines. 7) The voice feels consistent and natural.\n\nHowever, there's a critical issue with the rubric: it states 'The input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting. The model should have converted it to standard Fountain format.' This implies there was an original prose input that was converted. Without seeing the original input, I cannot verify whether dialogue was 'preserved exactly as written' or whether the author's voice was preserved 'without inventions.' The output itself could BE the invention rather than a conversion. That said, the output on its own is well-structured Fountain format.\n\nLooking at the output purely on structural merits: scene headings are correct, character cues are correct, parentheticals are correct, no markdown is present, and the formatting is clean. The content reads naturally and coherently. Since I cannot verify content preservation against an original, I'll evaluate based on what's visible - the structural formatting is excellent Fountain format. One minor note: action/description lines could benefit from blank line separation in some places for stricter Fountain compliance, but overall the formatting is solid.",

              "reason": "Evaluating against the rubric criteria:\n\n1. **Scene headings present and properly formatted (INT./EXT. ALL CAPS)?** - Yes. We see 'INT. COMMUNITY RADIO STUDIO', 'EXT. HILLTOP WATER TOWER - NIGHT', 'INT. STUDIO HALLWAY' — all in ALL CAPS with proper INT./EXT. prefixes. However, the first scene heading lacks a time-of-day indicator (e.g., - DAY or - NIGHT), which is standard Fountain convention, though not strictly required.\n\n2. **Character cues ALL CAPS on their own line?** - Yes. JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL are all on their own lines in ALL CAPS. NOAH (RADIO) is also properly formatted.\n\n3. **Dialogue preserved exactly as written?** - The rubric says the input was a prose narrative with no Fountain formatting, and the model should have converted it. Since I don't have the original prose input, I can only evaluate whether the output looks like a proper conversion. The dialogue appears natural and well-structured.\n\n4. **Parentheticals in (lowercase parens) format?** - Yes. Examples: '(setting down the mugs)', '(quietly)', '(shivering)', '(whispers)' — all lowercase in parentheses.\n\n5. **No markdown formatting?** - Correct. No >, #, **, ``` or other markdown artifacts are present.\n\n6. **Scene breaks identified correctly from context clues?** - Yes. Three distinct locations are identified: the radio studio interior, the hilltop water tower exterior, and the studio hallway. These are logical scene breaks.\n\n7. **Author's voice preserved without inventions?** - Without seeing the original prose, I can note the output reads naturally and doesn't appear to have extraneous additions. Action lines like 'Old gear hums while rain taps on the skylight' and 'Wind whips prayer flags tied to the guardrail' feel like preserved prose converted to action lines.\n\nThe formatting is largely correct Fountain format. Minor issues: the first scene heading lacks a time-of-day suffix, and some action lines read as stage directions mixed with narrative ('Noah tries to sound calm.' and 'Aria grins.' are acceptable but borderline). Overall, this is a solid Fountain conversion with good structural correctness and apparent content preservation.",

We are only given the output, not the original input, so we must evaluate the output on its own merits against the criteria.\n\n1. Scene headings: Present and properly formatted (INT.

Dialogue preservation: Cannot verify against original input, but dialogue appears natural and consistent - assumed PASS\n4. Parentheticals: Properly formatted in (lowercase parens) like (quietly), (shivering), (grinning), (whispering), (raising an eyebrow), (half-smiling) - PASS\n5. No markdown formatting: No >, #, **, ``` present - PASS\n6. Scene breaks: Multiple scene headings with logical transitions including CONTINUOUS - PASS\n7. Author's voice preservation: Cannot fully verify without original, but the writing feels cohesive and natural.\n\nThe output demonstrates strong Fountain formatting. The action lines are properly formatted as prose paragraphs. V.O. is correctly noted. The structure is clean and professional. One minor note: without seeing the original prose input, I cannot verify exact content preservation, but the output itself is well-structured Fountain format. The rubric says to evaluate the 'screenplay normalization' which implies conversion quality. The output is structurally sound Fountain format with no obvious issues.",

All are in ALL CAPS with proper INT./EXT. prefixes. ✓\n\n2. **Character cues**: ALL CAPS on their own lines - JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL, NOAH (V.O.) all appear correctly formatted. ✓\n\n3. **Dialogue preservation**: The dialogue appears natural and consistent. However, the rubric states this was converted from a prose narrative, so I cannot verify exact preservation against the original input (which is not provided). The dialogue reads well and appears coherent. Partial ✓\n\n4. **Parentheticals**: Present in (lowercase parens) format - (quietly), (shivering), (whispering). ✓\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: No >, #, **, ``` or other markdown symbols present. The output is clean Fountain-style text. ✓\n\n6. **Scene breaks identified correctly**: The four scene locations with appropriate time-of-day markers seem logically structured and flow naturally. ✓\n\n7. **Author's voice preserved without inventions**: Without seeing the original prose input, I cannot fully verify this. The rubric says the input was a prose narrative that should have been converted. The output reads like a well-structured screenplay.\n\nOne concern: The rubric says this is a 'screenplay normalization' from a 'prose narrative with no Fountain formatting,' but the original input is not provided for comparison. The output itself is well-formatted in Fountain style. Action lines are present and properly formatted (not in caps, not attributed as dialogue). The structure is clean.\n\nMinor issues: Some action lines read more like prose descriptions ('Aria grins') which is acceptable in screenwriting. The formatting is largely correct Fountain format.\n\nOverall, the structural formatting is strong and follows Fountain conventions well. Without the original to compare content preservation, I'll assess based on internal consistency and formatting quality, which are both good.",

All are in ALL CAPS with proper INT./EXT. prefixes. ✓\n\n2. **Character cues**: JUNE, NOAH, ARIA, KELL, NOAH (V.O.) are all in ALL CAPS on their own lines. ✓\n\n3. **Dialogue preservation**: Without the original prose input to compare against, I must assess whether dialogue reads naturally and consistently. The dialogue appears well-formed and consistent throughout. Based on the rubric stating 'dialogue preserved exactly as written,' I'll assume this is correct as there's no evidence of alteration. ✓\n\n4. **Parentheticals**: (setting down the mugs), (quietly), (shivering), (whispering) - all in lowercase within parentheses on their own lines. ✓\n\n5. **No markdown formatting**: There are no #, **, ```, > or other markdown symbols present. The output is plain text in Fountain-style format. ✓\n\n6. **Scene breaks**: The transitions between locations are identified - the studio, the hilltop water tower, the studio hallway, and back to the studio. These seem logically derived from context. ✓\n\n7. **Author's voice preservation**: Action lines describe settings and character actions. The descriptions like 'old gear hums while rain taps on the skylight' and 'wind whips prayer flags tied to the guardrail' feel like preserved prose converted to action lines. However, without seeing the original input, it's hard to verify nothing was invented. The rubric says the input was prose with no Fountain formatting, and the model converted it. The output reads coherently.\n\nMinor issues: Some action/description lines are written in a somewhat prose-heavy style (e.g., 'Noah tries to sound calm.') which is acceptable in screenwriting but slightly unusual. The format is largely correct Fountain - character names centered conceptually, dialogue beneath, parentheticals properly placed.\n\nOverall, this is a well-structured Fountain-formatted screenplay with proper scene headings, character cues, parentheticals, and no markdown artifacts. The conversion appears competent.",

The text is clean.\n\n4. **Dialogue preserved**: The dialogue appears natural and well-formatted. However, since I don't have the original input to compare word-for-word, I can only verify the output looks like properly formatted screenplay dialogue. The rubric says dialogue should be preserved exactly, but without the original input visible, I'll assess based on the output's internal consistency and formatting quality.\n\n5. **Parentheticals formatted correctly**: Yes - '(trying to sound calm)' and '(half-smiling)' are on their own lines, in parentheses, which is correct Fountain/screenplay format.\n\n6. **V.O. designation preserved**: Yes - 'NOAH (V.O.)' is present and correctly formatted.\n\n7. **CUT TO: transition**: 'CUT TO:' appears as plain text, not as a markdown header. Correct.\n\nThe output appears to be a clean, properly formatted screenplay with all markdown artifacts removed and proper Fountain conventions applied. All seven criteria appear to be met.",

The text is clean.\n\n4. **Dialogue preserved**: The dialogue appears natural and well-formatted. However, since I don't have the original input to compare word-for-word, I can only verify the output looks like proper screenplay dialogue. The rubric says dialogue should be preserved exactly, but without the input I'll assess based on the output's internal consistency, which looks good.\n\n5. **Parentheticals formatted correctly**: Yes - '(trying to sound calm)' and '(half-smiling)' are on their own lines in parentheses, which is correct Fountain/screenplay format.\n\n6. **V.O. designation preserved**: Yes - 'NOAH (V.O.)' is present and correctly formatted.\n\n7. **CUT TO: transition**: 'CUT TO:' appears as plain text, not as a markdown header. Correct.\n\nAll seven criteria appear to be met.

All key quality criteria are met. However, since I don't have the original broken input to compare dialogue word-for-word, I'm evaluating based on the output's conformance to proper Fountain/screenplay formatting and the absence of markdown artifacts.
