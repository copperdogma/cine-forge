The Mariner

What happens when a hero’s origin story crumbles?  
FADE IN:

EXT. CITY CENTRE \- NIGHT

A ruined city. Fires burn here and there, some from barrels with huddled homeless homeless warming themselves, others from destroyed buildings. A fallen skyscraper has carved away chunks of its neighbours, filling an intersection with rubble. Gunshots and screams are heard. Sirens are far in the distance.

OPENING TITLE

In 2020 the pandemic swept the globe. Everyone who could work remotely did, hollowing out the skyscrapers. The cascading bank failures and commercial real estate collapse of 2025 turned these once pristine urban centres into sprawling no-go zones. Vigilanties arise to do what the police couldn’t.

EXT. RUDDY & GREENE BUILDING \- FRONT \- NIGHT

Classic 15-story sandstone building. Once beautiful, now riddled with bullet holes and graffiti. Parked outside are rows of high-end European SUVs.

EXT. RUDDY & GREENE BUILDING \- REAR \- NIGHT

Grimy alley. A delivery van rolls up. “McAngus Fish & Brewis” painted on the side with a giant fake fish on top.

THE MARINER, hidden in shadow, gets out of the van and flings open the building’s back door, his huge frame silhouetted against the interior’s light. He charges in. All we hear are the sounds: yells, violent fighting, silence. Heavy footsteps, DING, elevator doors open, muzak version of “Faith” by George Michael playing with Mariner humming along, elevator doors close.

As the elevator rises, one window lights up on each floor, all the way to the very top.

More sounds: DING, elevator opens, “Faith” playing, yelling, running, gunfire, screams, silence. Heavy footsteps. A door kicked in, more gunfire, fighting, wet cracking sounds, silence.

ROSE (O.S.)  
Billy?\!

MARINER (O.S.)  
Not today\! C’mon, we gotta go.

More sounds: two people running down a hallway, a single gunshot, THWACK, nothing. DING, elevator doors.

INT. RUDDY & GREEN BUILDING \- ELEVATOR

UB40's "I Can't Help Falling in Love With You" muzak.

ROSE (mid-30s) leans against the elevator wall, panting. She’s wearing a Tim Hortons uniform, her hair is a mess, and there’s blood spattered on her face.

She looks right, pants a few more times, then squints in disgust. She gingerly picks up a bloody scrap of something with hair on it. She snorts and drops it.

ROSE  
Is that skull??

Next to her is Mariner, also panting, covered in far more blood. His face is broad, stoic, and frowning. He has gray-blue eyes and a thick, curly, beard barely streaked with gray. He wears a red knit cap and a small mask.

FULL-SCREEN SUPERIMPOSED TITLE CARD: “THE MARINER”

He blinks a few times as a drop of blood falls from his eyebrow. He looks toward her, then spits out some blood.

MARINER  
Yeaaaaah...

He’s built like a pro-wrestler. Moss green SWEATER stretched over his huge frame, sleeves rolled showing heavy leather BRACERS adorned with anchors. His inner forearm has a classic heart-and-arrow TATTOO with “Dad” in the centre. Across his chest is a BANDOLIER of bright red 12-gauge shells, FISH HOOKS hanging from the bottom edge. Heavy rubberized BOOTS go past his knees. A CAPE of heavy FISHING NET edged with WEIGHTS hangs from his shoulders.

He holds a STOUT WOODEN OAR in both hands, edged with METAL and dripping with BLOOD. He shakes it to dislodge another GRISLY BIT which hits the ground with a wet plop.

ROSE  
How the hell did you find me?

Mariner looks down and mumbles something.

ROSE  
(annoyed)  
What?

MARINER  
AirTag.

ROSE  
What??

MARINER  
I stashed an AirTag in your purse. Last Thanksgiving at ma’s.

ROSE  
Shit\! My purse\!

MARINER  
Just in case\! I worry about--

ROSE  
Shut it\! We gotta go back for it.

MARINER  
What? No way\! I’m taking you home. It’s my fault they went after you. I never thought they’d--

ROSE  
(laughing)  
You think they’re after you?

Mariner looks confused. DING \- elevator doors open on 12\.

Three THUGS are waiting for them. THUG 1 raises his GUN... Mariner SWINGS HIS OAR in an arc, catching the gun... BANG \- shot goes high, GUN FLIES out of his hand... Mariner SIDE-KICKS him in the chest... Thug 1 FLIES back, knocking the others to the GROUND.

Rose has been frantically pressing the CLOSE DOOR button.

The thugs struggle to their feet.

THUG 2  
(into radio)  
We’ve got them on twelve.

THUGS 2 & 3 DRAW GUNS. BLAM BLAM BLAM. Rose and Mariner LEAP to the side... DOORS begin to CLOSE... Thug 2 LUNGES at the elevator BUTTON... Mariner’s OAR flashes through the closing doors... Thug 2 SCREAMS and CURSES... Doors close.

THUG  
(muffled)  
Go\! Go\! Down to eight\!

Rose presses 11\.

ROSE  
We’ll take the stairs up. They won’t expect that.

MARINER  
Because it’s stupid\!

Rose raises an eyebrow at Mariner’s crazy outfit.

MARINER  
It’s functional\! ... And an homage.

DING. Doors open. Rose peers out. Silence.

MARINER  
(whispering)  
Rose... No\!

Rose quietly darts out of the elevator. Mariner tries to grab her but misses. He hesitates... Doors start closing. Mariner dashes out after her, grumbling.

INT. 11TH FLOOR \- CONTINUOUS

They hunt for a stairwell through the dim corridors. Lights flicker, papers and office furniture litter the hallway.

ROSE  
Wait. Did you mean an homage to... dad? Are you ser--

MARINER  
Shh\!

He PULLS her into an EMPTY ROOM. They hide behind a toppled FILING CABINET and listen, catching their breath. Someone slowly walks by. Mariner looks down at his “Dad” TATTOO.

BEGIN FLASHBACK: EXT. COASTLINE \- DAY \- PAST

Young Mariner (8) and his dad (30s, fisherman) bob happily in a wooden sailboat near the shoreline. Golden light bathes them. Dad is behind Mariner, teaching him to cast. They laugh and smile, enjoying the day.

DAD  
Oi, me bosun. Ya knows what’s a hero? ‘E’s the one what’s brave an true. You remembers that. Go on now an fetch yer pa anudder.

Young Mariner nods, fetching a beer with the seriousness of a young boy with a job to do.

END FLASHBACK.

Rose nudges him, breaking his reverie. He grabs her hand and leads her out of the room. They find a stairwell.

INT. STAIRWELL \- CONTINUOUS

She goes up, he goes down.

MARINER  
You mad? We have to go\! I’ll buy you a new bloody purse.

ROSE  
It ain’t the purse. It’s... a blockchain password to my life savings. I hid it on a chip in the lining. It’s all I got, Billy\!

She gives a pleading look and heads up stairs. Mariner follows, grumbling.

INT. 12TH FLOOR STAIRWELL \- CONTINUOUS

MARINER  
The hell’s a blockchain?

BOOM \- A thug (ROSCO) opens the stairwell door, slamming Rose into Mariner. They stumble... Mariner YANKS Rosco into the stairwell... SMASHES his face into the wall... Rosco drops his GUN... Rose picks it up and points it at the back of his head as Mariner keeps him pressed into the wall.

ROSE  
Hey, Rosco. Explain blockchain.

ROSCO  
(panicked, face smooshed)  
What?\!

Rose cocks the gun.

ROSCO  
Okay, okay\! It’s, uh, a decentralized digital ledger detailing asset ownership. Untraceable. Oh man, Mr. Salvatori’s gonna kill ya, Rosie.

Rose nods “yes," maybe at both things. She motions for Mariner to do something to Rosco.

ROSCO  
He ain’t gonna let you walk with 20 mil--

Mariner cracks his head into the wall and Rosco crumples. Rose tucks the gun into her pants. Mariner stares at her.

MARINER  
Was he going to say 20 million? And how the hell do you know these assholes?

Rose starts up the stairs again. Mariner grabs her arm. She struggles. He lets her go. She scowls at him.

ROSE  
I stole it, okay? From these assholes. It’s gang money.

MARINER  
You got me involved in stealing gang money?

ROSE  
Who got you involved, Mr. Fucking AirTag?

Rose storms up the stairs and out of the door to the 13th floor. Mariner follows.

INT. 13TH FLOOR

VINNIE, MIKEY, and CARLOS patrol the ruined corridor.

MIKEY  
You heard about WaldoCoin?

VINNIE  
Man, that shit’s a scam. You gotta get into PonziCoin. My cousin’s in it. He says it’s legit.

They hear the stairwell door slam open on the other side of the floor and angry voices. Vinnie puts a finger to his lips and motions Mikey and Carlos to follow.

MARINER (O.S.)  
We’re leaving. Now. I don’t steal, Rose. It’s against my code.

The thugs creep down the hallway toward the voices.

ROSE (O.S.)  
(laughing but angry)  
From criminals? We take it, their gang collapses. And what code??

Vinnie motions the others to stop at the corner, gun ready.

MARINER (O.S.)  
I live by the Mariner’s code: honesty, bravery, and grit. A true hero never backs down from a fight.

ROSE (O.S.)  
You know who you sound like...

The thugs appear at the end of the hallway, guns raised.

CARLOS  
Freeze, assholes\! On the ground\!

VINNIE  
Rosey, baby. We don’t wanna hurt ya. Mr. Salvatori just wants his password. That’s all. Then maybe, if you’re reeeaal nice, maybe you can be my booty call some more.

Rose’s eyes narrow. Mariner scowls and steps in front.

MIKEY  
Hey, Finding Nemo, drop the piece.

VINNIE cackles. Mainer slowly unholsters his weapon \- a fat, bright-orange pistol.

MIKEY  
Is that a... flare gun?

The thugs all start laughing. POP \- Blinding red flare streaks out... Mariner spins, broad back protecting Rose... Flare hits VINNIE in the chest. He SCREAMS and drops, still screaming. BLAM-BLAM-BLAM \- Thugs fire... One shot hits Mariner’s back... He shoves Rose through an open door...

Rose sees the stark red light of the flare and hears VINNIE’S screams as it continues to burn. Mariner lunges toward the other thugs. BLAM-BLAM. THUMP. GRUNT. CRACK. SCREAM. BLAM. Rose peeks out. Mariner is holding Mikey and Carlos by the necks, a foot off the ground. CRUNCH \- he cracks their heads together and they drop.

Rose joins Mariner as he wipes his BLOODY OAR on Carlos’ back. “BOSUN” is carved into the wood. Rose gives Vinnie’s body a kick.

ROSE  
Prick. Oh shit\! You’re bleeding.

She rips off a strip of her uniform and wraps it around Mariner’s leg. She eyes the holes in his sweater.

MARINER  
I hate your boyfriend.

ROSE  
Ex boyfriend. Yeah I know. Vinnie’s unique... charm convinced me that robbing these jackasses was the right move.

MARINER  
He convinced me, too. C’mon.

INT. 15TH FLOOR

This floor isn’t destroyed like the others. It’s CLEAN, LUXURIOUS, and DIMLY LIT, like an old nightclub. Mariner’s opening fight is evident: pooled blood and gouged walls.

The stairwell door opens. Mariner and Rose edge into the corridor. They pass a number of ROOMS: pool table, cigar lounge, a smashed door with a chair and ropes on the floor.

At the end of the hallway they stop at a sturdy closed door. Rose nods. Mariner checks the handle. Locked.

Mariner shoves his OAR into the doorframe and strains. CREAK. He bears down harder, veins rising on his neck, muscles bulging. CREAK. CRACK. CRASH \- It splinters open.

They survey the room: huge wooden DESK atop a thick Persian RUG, BOOKSHELVES of leather-bound books, fine BOOZE fills a glass case, mismatched PAINTINGS of different periods, and a bowl of MINTS on the desk. Next to that, a PURSE.

Rose tiptoes in and picks up her PURSE as Mariner moves to check two SIDE DOORS.

ROSE  
Christ you’re strong, Billy. That’s gotta be juice, right?

BEGIN FLASHBACK: EXT. BACKYARD \- DAY \- PAST

The warm sun dapples through trees in the idyllic yard, a trim house with a homemade pie in the window. Young Mariner’s dad patiently explains the basics of weightlifting. Mariner struggles to bench press, dad encouraging and helping him. He makes it. They laugh. Dad puts his arm around him and tousles his hair.

DAD  
Yer gonna be a scrapper, ya knows that? Jus remember, me bosun, don’t never run from a fight. Not again, ya hears me? It’s not what a man does. It’s not what a MacAngus does. Let’s do a round.

Mariner nods, lips pursed in resolve. He has a black eye.

END FLASHBACK.

MARINER  
Just hours of pumpin’ tin, sis. Just like dad taught me.

ROSE  
You’re serious about this dad shit? You talking about the summer he took you to buddy’s place?

MARINER  
(through gritted teeth)  
Dad taught me everything. Sailing, fishing, fighting. How to get strong and be brave. How to be a man. Everything. It broke me when he died.

ROSE  
Died\!?

Rose turns to Mariner.

ROSE (CONT’D)  
Seriously? All these years you thought he was dead? Is that what you told yourself? Is that why you thought he never came to see you? 

MARINER  
What are you saying?

ROSE  
Christ, Billy, he’s living up in  Chimney Bay with some skank. He was on the pogey that summer at buddy’s\! He was supposed to be taking care of you. Instead he’d ditch you in his deadbeat friend’s yard all summer while they got shit faced.

MARINER  
(quietly)  
Bullshit. Ma would’a said.

ROSE  
You were too young, Will. She didn’t want to break your heart.

Mariner looks lost; a hulking bearded man with the eyes of a wounded child.

TINKLE \- ICE in a TUMBLER of scotch melts. As they look at the desk, they notice a STILL-BURNING CIGAR.

A VOICE booms from the door they entered through.

SALVATORI (O.S.)  
(Russian accent)  
Rosey\! Somehow I just knew you’d be back.

Two THUGS burst in through the office doors, GUNS raised. Rose retreats behind the desk. Mariner stares vacantly.

SALVATORI enters, holding a SUBMACHINE GUN. He’s WHITE FROM HEAD TO TOE: white silk suit, tie, shirt, shoes. White hair pulled back into a small ponytail, and a finely groomed white MOUSTACHE. His red-tinted glasses stand out in contrast. He wears a thick hoop earring, gold rings on each finger, and has a single GOLDEN TOOTH.

Salvatori strides confidently up to Rose, submachine gun levelled at her gut. He never breaks eye contact with her.

SALVATORI  
You brought a big man with you.

EXT. BACKYARD \- DAY \- (FLASHBACK)

The yard is overgrown with WEEDS, DISCARDED BOTTLES, some RUSTY WEIGHTS, and a BENCH PRESS repaired with peeling duct-tape. Young Mariner’s dad PUNCHES him in the face.

DAD  
Jeeeeezuz,  b'y, ya gots to stand up fer yerself, bosun\! No wonders ya got yer ass whupped. Hands up, now\! Don’t never run from a fight again, ya hear?

Mariner nods, lips pursed in resolve. Dad PUNCHES him again.

DAD  
Fer fuck sakes\! Yer a bag a sad. Go lift some tin till yer a man.

Dad heads into the house in DISGUST, kicking a BOTTLE which SMASHES against the stucco. Mariner, wiping a split lip, goes to the BENCH PRESS and struggles to add some weights.

INT. STAIRWELL \- (BACK TO PRESENT)

SALVATORI  
Who are you, big man?

MARINER  
(quietly)  
Nobody.

SALVATORI  
You certainly look like you’re trying to be somebody. Like a big fucking hero.

EXT. COASTLINE \- DAY \- (FLASHBACK)

Young Mariner in a boat, the bottom littered with empty beer bottles. Dad is pissing off the side. Mariner is under-dressed and shivering.

DAD  
Ya know whats a hero, b’y? It’s got two thumbs and ‘e looks like this\! Ha\! Now fetch me anudder. An don’t gimme no sass abouts it like yer mudder.

EXT. BACKYARD \- DAY \- (FLASHBACK)

SALVATORI (CONT’D)  
So? Are you a big fucking hero?

MARINER  
(quietly)  
No.

The thugs take Mariner’s OAR and kick the back of his legs so he’s kneeling at their feet. Mariner doesn’t resist.

BLAM. Salvatori fires a SHOT into the bookcase behind Rose. Mariner flinches and Rose stifles a scream.

SALVATORI  
Memory stick, Rosey.

Rose swallows.

ROSE  
He’s no hero. He’s a gullible ass who spent his entire life in the shadow of a loser.

Mariner closes his eyes and hangs his head. Salvatori smirks at this.

ROSE  
I know a hero, though. He sees the best in people even if they don’t deserve it. He grew up in a shitty home with a shitty father who kicked the crap out of him and then abandoned him for some junkie. And instead of following that path, he forged his own.

Mariner looks up at Rose, eyes moist.

SALVATORI  
Okay, okay, shut up now.

ROSE  
He’s a model of honesty and bravery and grit. He somehow turned a deadbeat father into a superhero. Then became a real one.

Salvatori points his GUN at Rose’s head.

SALVATORI  
(screaming)  
PASSWORD, ROSE. NOW\!

ROSE  
And he never backs down from a fight.

A smile crosses Mariner’s face as he clenches his hands into fists.

CUT TO BLACK.
