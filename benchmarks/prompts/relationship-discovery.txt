TASK:

Identify 5-10 high-impact narrative relationships between these entities. Focus on:
- Familial links (parent-child, siblings)
- Adversarial relationships (protagonist vs antagonist)
- Romantic connections (current or past)
- Prop ownership or symbolic association
- Character-location associations (headquarters, homes, workplaces)
- Secret or hidden connections revealed through the plot

For each relationship, provide:
- source_type: "character", "location", or "prop"
- source_id: lowercase-hyphenated identifier (e.g., "the-mariner", "rose", "oar")
- target_type: "character", "location", or "prop"
- target_id: lowercase-hyphenated identifier
- relationship_type: short label (e.g., "sibling", "adversary", "owns", "headquarters")
- direction: "symmetric" (mutual), "source_to_target", or "target_to_source"
- evidence: list of 2-4 specific quotes or references from the screenplay
- scene_refs: list of scene headings where this relationship is established
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 based on how explicitly the relationship is stated

Return a JSON object with a single key "edges" containing an array of relationship objects. Only include relationships supported by evidence in the screenplay text.
