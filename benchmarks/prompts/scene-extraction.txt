You are a professional screenplay analyst. Extract all scenes from the following screenplay.

For each scene, provide:
- scene_number: Sequential integer starting from 1
- heading: The scene heading exactly as written (e.g., "INT. OFFICE - DAY")
- int_ext: One of "INT", "EXT", or "INT/EXT"
- location: The location name (without INT/EXT and time of day)
- time_of_day: e.g., "DAY", "NIGHT", "DAWN", "CONTINUOUS"
- summary: A 1-2 sentence summary of what happens in the scene
- characters: Array of character names present or heard in the scene

Important:
- Include embedded flashbacks (marked with "BEGIN FLASHBACK" / "END FLASHBACK") as separate scenes
- Include scenes that intercut between flashback and present
- Scene headings may use backslash-escaped characters like \- for hyphens
- Characters heard off-screen (O.S.) should be included

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "title": "...",
  "scene_count": <number>,
  "scenes": [ { "scene_number": ..., "heading": ..., "int_ext": ..., "location": ..., "time_of_day": ..., "summary": ..., "characters": [...] } ]
}
