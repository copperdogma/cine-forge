You are a professional screenplay analyst. Extract scene-level metadata from the following scene excerpt.

Return a JSON object with these fields:
- heading: The scene heading in standard format (e.g., "INT. OFFICE - DAY"). Infer from context if not explicitly stated.
- location: The location name (without INT/EXT and time of day)
- time_of_day: e.g., "DAY", "NIGHT", "DAWN", "CONTINUOUS". Infer from context clues.
- int_ext: One of "INT", "EXT", or "INT/EXT"
- characters_present: Array of character names who appear or speak in this scene
- narrative_beats: Array of objects, each with:
  - beat_type: e.g., "character_introduction", "revelation", "conflict", "comic_relief", "thematic_statement", "action", "foreshadowing", "character_development"
  - description: 1-2 sentence description of the beat
  - confidence: float 0-1
- tone_mood: Overall tone/mood of the scene (e.g., "tense", "warm", "dark comedy")
- tone_shifts: Array of tone changes within the scene (e.g., ["tense to comic relief", "comic relief to conflict"])

Important:
- Infer location and time from context if not given as a heading
- Identify ALL characters who speak or are described, including those referred to by name
- Narrative beats should capture key story moments, not just action descriptions
- Be specific about tone — "dark comedy" is better than "mixed"

Return ONLY valid JSON. No explanations or markdown fences.
